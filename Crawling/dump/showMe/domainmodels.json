Simulation based manufacturing system improvement is applied to their component manufacturing plant. Based on the high number of items in the real case, a method for reduction of simulation model complexity applying item aggregation is developed in this paper. In the first improvement step, strategic capacity investment decisions are supported with the use of simulation. In the second step, a MRP planning parameter optimization is performed to improve service level and inventory. Additionally, the effect of capacity related decisions concerning setup time reduction and load-dependent outsourcing is evaluated. The results of this simulation study show that service level and inventory can be significantly improved by optimization of planning parameters and reduction of setup times. In addition, the study shows that load-dependent outsourcing is a viable alternative to capacity investment.","publicationTitle":"Simulation Conference (WSC), 2017 Winter","authors":["Andreas J.

Application of the spectral method to the synthesis of electric drive control systems is under consideration. The wavelet spectrum processing capability estimation under the conditions of digital implementation of the controller and automatic control systems in general is given. It is proposed to use a system of basis functions different from the traditional one. Main requirements to basis functions are considered. The approach based on the integrated form of equations is proposed and its advantages for solution of the set problems are revealed. The conditions for the generating wavelet are stated and the possibility of numerical implementation based on the function of inverse wavelet transform is shown. It is illustrated that the dyadic wavelet transform of signals meets the basic requirements for basic functions systems. The suggested method guarantees that, in case of arbitrary increase of the rank members, the loss of the synthesis algorithm numerical stability would only be concerned with the peculiarities of the computer and the implementation of linear algebra algorithms.","publicationTitle":"Industrial Engineering, Applications and Manufacturing (ICIEAM), 2017 International Conference on","authors":["M.

ROSUB 6000 system consists of a free swimming ROV, tether management system (TMS), power container, control console container, Launching and retrieval system (LARS) and electro optical umbilical cable. Developmental work of ROSUB 6000 system started from March 2003. During the developmental phase and several depth qualification sea trials various kinds of mechanical engineering challenges were encountered. This paper enumerates the challenges encountered. Water entry is one of the major challenges in subsea systems. Water entry through pressure housings may be catastrophic, since pressure housings carries control electronics. Control electronics switches off when water entry alarm is given stopping all the ROV operations. Water entry in the pressure cases of ROV has happened several times. Each instance the reason behind the water entry was different. Failure of components like torque arrester in TMS deep sea winch and thruster frames were analyzed and suitable methodologies to avoid these failures are brought into the practice. Challenges in deck handling of ROV and TMS are weather conditions and tether twist during initial attachment of ROV with TMS. One another big challenge is the launching and retrieval of the system. Challenges due to rough seas, launching and retrieval system hydraulic system faults, operational human errors and their effects on the system components are recorded and reviewed to improve the system reliability. The importance of buoyancy corrections and hydraulic system maintenance were learnt during the various phases of lab and field testing of the deep water ROV.","publicationTitle":"Underwater Technology (UT), 2017 IEEE","references":{},"authors":["D.

Product Development and Entrepreneurship is taught at IST mostly for students of mechanical engineering, whereas Advanced Product Development Methodologies is taught at IPCA mostly for industrial design students and New Product Development is taught at ISCTE for business students. All three courses use the same methodology of assessment and the same overall syllabus, with distributed assignments and expected outcomes. However, the nature and emphasis of specific aspects of the students projects are fundamentally different. The reasons for these differences are analyzed by the faculty involved, in the context of the students background and goals and examples are given.

By adapting video games and taking advantage of their technical features such as 3D effects, audio, Internet communications, etc., educators can deliver certain course materials through these games. Meanwhile, whether, or to what extent, these educational adaptations enhance the students learning effectiveness is still the subject of research. In a mechanical engineering educational laboratory, students may face theories or concepts that they have just learned, mechanical devices that they have not previously used as well as collaborative tasks that they have not been assigned before. While traditional educational laboratories may be constrained by hardware, an adaptation of video games may help the students. An immersive gear train laboratory has been developed in which a popular first-person shooting game, Garrys Mod, was adapted. In this paper, an evaluation of this adaptation is presented from both a laboratory performance perspective and a learning effectiveness perspective. 110 undergraduate students who took the junior-level Machine Dynamics and Mechanisms course in the authors university performed video game-based gear train laboratory exercises immediately after attending the lectures and completing the homework related to the chapter on gear design. They were required to form groups for completing the laboratory tasks in the video game environment, where their operations were recorded. Short tests were given to the students before and after the laboratory exercises in order to assess whether their understanding of the course material was enhanced by the laboratory exercises. It was found that the students performance in the laboratory exercises is more likely to be affected by their understanding of the course material than by their familiarity with first-person shooting games. From these tests, it was observed that most students showed an improvement in understanding the course contents after completing the laboratory exercises.","publicationTitle":"Frontiers in Education Conference (FIE), 2016 IEEE","references":{"378261":{"upvotes":[],"downvotes":[],"id":"378261","comments":[]}},"authors":["Yizhe Chang","El-Sayed Aziz","Zhou Zhang","Mingshao Zhang","Sven K.

The access of the internet is easier day by day. My personal experience shows the young generation use smartphones, tablets to keep in contact with friends at home, on public transport, in the school etc. except sleeping. They use different communication forms like community sides, chat rooms and so on. These applications are protected by password authentication system to keep save the data of the users. I was interested for which systems find the mechanical engineering students important in everyday life and what kind of password use for protecting the information. Why is it important? We see almost in every month in the news a service provider was attacked again by hackers and the have put the username and the passwords on the Internet. The success of the attack depends on user error mainly. The companies store sometimes the important data without any protection. On the other hand the users share sensitive information on the community sites (\u0026#x201C;I am going to a party today evening\u0026#x201D;, \u0026#x201C;I am on holiday by the see\u0026#x201D; it means my home is empty tonight if I leave alone). I find the information security is a very important question today when we use lot of systems and we store the important information on devices, in cloud and so on. We have to know how can protect our information so I thought the basics of the information security in subject Informatics I. for the mechanical engineering students in the first semester because they do not have any subject which would include information about this topic. The students filled out an information security awareness questionnaire after the second semester. The multidimensional analysis shows which communication systems are more important to the students. These communications systems are protected by password authentication it means the next step of the analysis how long and how complicated password are used by students after the basic information security course in the first semester. The students had to say, how long password they are using by the most important systems like e-mail, community sites, and so on. The longer password is safer then shorter as we know. The following important question is how complicated is the used password. Is it include just lowercase letters, or include some uppercase letters too? Is it include maybe numbers or special characters like \u0026#x201C;;\u0026#x201D; or \u0026#x201C;,\u0026#x201D;? We need to know some more information about the used passwords. How often change the students these passwords? Are they using same passwords by different systems or one same password? In that case if they use same password it is more important to be the password complicated in other case if it is hacked, the attackers can log on in other systems too what the students use. After the analysis I could see how effective was the basic information security course for the mechanical engineering students. How could I build the information security awareness by them? Was it enough, or should I waste more time on this topic to help them to keep save the sensitive data?","publicationTitle":"Information Technology Based Higher Education and Training (ITHET), 2016 15th International Conference on","references":{},"authors":["Gabor Kiss","Antonia Szasz"],"link":"http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/7760758/","id":"7760758"},{"publicationYear":"2016","doi":"10.1109/SysEng.2016.7753192","stream":"Mechanical Engineering","title":"Target-oriented implementation of systems engineering in medium-sized enterprises: Project example for mbse implementation in mechanical and plant engineering","abstract":"Technical systems of tomorrow will go beyond current traditional mechatronic designs by incorporating inherent intelligence.

Designing an undergraduate course in mechatronics poses a challenge as it integrates subareas in mechanics, computer science, electronics and control systems. The problem is compounded when students are from different fields of engineering and have diverse backgrounds and skills. We describe a competition-based framework that has been integrated with rigorous labs to develop skills in core areas that are needed to complete a course capstone project successfully. Students learn the basics of mechatronics and, in the project, develop a mobile robot. The project varies from year to year. Our course is based on the low-cost Arduino platform. This paper briefly discusses pedagogical strategies and tools that have been used at other schools, and then focuses on describing the lecture, laboratory, and project components of our course. The results are encouraging and indicate that our course structure provides an effective means for learning mechatronics.","publicationTitle":"Interdisciplinary Engineering Design Education Conference (IEDEC), 2014 4th","authors":["Radhika Grover","Shoba Krishnan","Terry Shoup","Maryam Khanbaghi"],"link":"http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/6784685/","references":{"6112607":{"upvotes":[],"downvotes":[],"id":"6112607","comments":[]},"6297492":{"upvotes":[],"downvotes":[],"id":"6297492","comments":[]},"5508395":{"upvotes":[],"downvotes":[],"id":"5508395","comments":[]},"6451030":{"upvotes":[],"downvotes":[],"id":"6451030","comments":[]},"5971240":{"upvotes":[],"downvotes":[],"id":"5971240","comments":[]},"6363494":{"upvotes":[],"downvotes":[],"id":"6363494","comments":[]},"4957226":{"upvotes":[],"downvotes":[],"id":"4957226","comments":[]}},"id":"6784685"},{"publicationYear":"2015","doi":"10.1109/ITHET.2015.7218040","stream":"Mechanical Engineering","title":"That flipping classroom - getting engineering students to be consciously competent on their own","abstract":"This paper is inspired by the Keynote Speech which I gave at ITHET 2014 in York in September 2014.

Embedded computers and networks monitor and control the physical processes, usually with feedback loops where physical processes affect computations and vice versa. The economic and societal potential of such systems is vastly greater than what has been realized, and major investments are being made worldwide to develop the technology. There are considerable challenges, particularly because the physical components of such systems introduce safety and reliability requirements qualitatively different from those in general-purpose computing. Moreover, physical components are qualitatively different from object-oriented software components. Standard abstractions based on method calls and threads do not work. This paper examines the challenges in designing such systems, and in particular raises the question of whether today\u0026#x02019;s computing and networking technologies provide an adequate foundation for CPS. It concludes that it will not be sufficient to improve design processes, raise the level of abstraction, or verify (formally or otherwise) designs that are built on today\u0026#x02019;s abstractions. To realize the full potential of CPS, we will have to rebuild computing and networking abstractions.

The interface designer is in charge of adjusting the range of optimal speeds according to the scale of the environment and the desired user experience. However, this approach is not valid for complex environments (e.g. multi-scale environments). Optimal speeds might vary for each section of the environment, leading to non-desired side effects such as collisions or simulator sickness. Thereby, we propose a speedadaptation algorithm based on the spatial relationship between the user and the environment and the users perception of motion. The computed information is used to adjust the navigation speed in order to provide an optimal navigation speed and avoid collisions. Two main benefits of our approach is firstly, the ability to adapt the navigation speed in multi-scale environments and secondly, the capacity to provide a smooth navigation experience by decreasing the jerkiness of described trajectories. The evaluation showed that our approach provides comparable performance as existing navigation techniques but it significantly decreases the jerkiness of described trajectories.","publicationTitle":"3D User Interfaces (3DUI), 2014 IEEE Symposium on","references":{"6790873":{"upvotes":[],"downvotes":[],"id":"6790873","comments":[]},"5307640":{"upvotes":[],"downvotes":[],"id":"5307640","comments":[]},"5759212":{"upvotes":[],"downvotes":[],"id":"5759212","comments":[]},"6479208":{"upvotes":[],"downvotes":[],"id":"6479208","comments":[]}},"authors":["Ferran Argelaguet"],"link":"http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/7027325/","id":"7027325"},{"publicationYear":"2000","doi":"10.1162/105474600566952","stream":"Mechanical Engineering","title":"Duration and Exposure to Virtual Environments: Sickness Curves During and Across Sessions","abstract":"Although simulator sickness is known to increase with protracted exposure and to diminish with repeated sessions, limited systematic research has been performed in these areas.

This evaluation confirmed that longer exposures produce more symptoms and that total sickness subsides over repeated exposures. Additional evaluation was performed to investigate the precise form of this relationship and to determine whether the same form was generalizable across varied simulator environments. The results indicated that exposure duration and repeated exposures are significantly linearly related to sickness outcomes (duration being positively related and repetition negatively related to total sickness). This was true over diverse systems and large subject pools. This result verified the generalizability of the relationships among sickness, exposure duration, and repeated exposures.

We conducted two user studies to evaluate the effectiveness of the change blindness illusion when exploring a virtual environment that was an order of magnitude larger than the physical walking space. Despite the dynamically changing environment, participants were able to draw coherent sketch maps of the environment structure, and pointing task results indicated that they were able to maintain their spatial orientation within the virtual world. Only one out of 77 participants across both both studies definitively noticed that a scene change had occurred, suggesting that change blindness redirection provides a remarkably compelling illusion.

Based on both the survey and interview data, the authors recommend adjusting curricula to include the practice of cooperative problem-solving, to make evaluation of communication competence a component of grades, and to require students to take both a technical writing and public presentation course.","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Professional Communication","authors":["D.

Flipping a classroom refers to reversing the traditional role of in- and out-of-class activities. This instructional approach is sometimes also called inverting a classroom. In a flipped paradigm, the students are introduced to topics and basic concepts using video lectures or other means during their time outside of the classroom and spend the scheduled class period working on exercises under the supervision of the instructor. Instead of being a sage on the stage the instructor now becomes a guide on the side [1]. The conventional paradigm treats the student as an empty container into which knowledge is poured, while the flipped paradigm treats the student as an active learner who reconstructs knowledge from information. The flipped classroom began to receive increasing attention in the early 2000s (e.g., [2] and [3]) and has become much more accessible to instructors recently with the advent of low-cost screencasting software, e.g., [4], and Web-based course and video management tools.

The SS-capture system removes barriers that ordinarily inhibit average teachers in faculties of engineering, who often lack a background in educational technology, from implementing a flipped classroom.

Classroom inversion or \u0026#x201C;flipping\u0026#x201D; can provide a useful framework for this new paradigm by pre-engaging students with the material. The classroom lecture can then be replaced with collaborative problem solving exercises or model eliciting activities. While the most common methods used for pre-engagement include streamed lectures or podcasts, these techniques are subject to some of the same concerns associated with passive lectures or assigned readings. In this paper we present an approach for classroom inversion that is based on three premises: pre-engagement occurs through online interactive modules, classroom lectures are replaced with group problem solving activities, and homework assignments incorporate open ended problems or model eliciting activities.

They can be divided in two main classes: polynomial time tests and exact tests. Polynomial time tests can efficiently be used for online guarantee of real-time applications, where tasks are activated at runtime. These tests introduce a negligible overhead, when executed upon a new task arrival, however provide only a sufficient schedulability condition, which may cause a poor processor utilization. On the other hand, exact tests, which are based on response time analysis, provide a necessary and sufficient schedulability condition, but are too complex to be executed on line for large task sets. As a consequence, for large task sets, they are often executed off line. This paper proposes a novel approach for analyzing the schedulability of periodic task sets on a single processor under an arbitrary fixed priority assignment: Using this approach, we derive a new schedulability test which can be tuned through a parameter to balance complexity versus acceptance ratio, so that it can be used on line to better exploit the processor, based on the available computational power. Extensive simulations show that our test, when used in its exact form, is significantly faster than the current response time analysis methods. Moreover the proposed approach, for its elegance and compactness, offers an explanation of some known phenomena of fixed priority scheduling and could be helpful for further work on schedulability analysis.","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Computers","authors":["E.

A typical control application consists of periodic software tasks together with a mode-switching logic for enabling and disabling tasks. Giotto specifies time-triggered sensor readings, task invocations, actuator updates, and mode switches independent of any implementation platform. Giotto can be annotated with platform constraints such as task-to-host mappings, and task and communication schedules. The annotations are directives for the Giotto compiler, but they do not alter the functionality and timing of a Giotto program. By separating the platform-independent from the platform-dependent concerns, Giotto enables a great deal of flexibility in choosing control platforms as well as a great deal of automation in the validation and synthesis of control software. The time-triggered nature of Giotto achieves timing predictability, which makes Giotto particularly suitable for safety-critical applications.","publicationTitle":"Proceedings of the IEEE","authors":["T.A.

In our formalism a component implements a set of task sequences that share a resource. A component interface consists of an arrival rate function and a latency for each task sequence, and a capacity function for the shared resource. The interface specifies that the component guarantees certain task latencies depending on assumptions about task arrival rates and allocated resource capacities. Our algebra defines compatibility and refinement relations on interfaces. Interface compatibility can be checked on partial designs, even when some component interfaces are yet unknown. In this case interface composition computes as new assumptions the weakest constraints on the unknown components that are necessary to satisfy the specified guarantees. Interface refinement is defined in a way that ensures that compatible interfaces can be refined and implemented independently. Our algebra thus formalizes an interface-based design methodology that supports both the incremental addition of new components and the independent stepwise refinement of existing components. We demonstrate the flexibility and efficiency of the framework through simulation experiments.","publicationTitle":"Real-Time and Embedded Technology and Applications Symposium, 2006.

PC clocks are accurate enough when connected within a network, but a new requirement is for them to be synchronized, which means that they should show the same time at the same instant. The most prominent time-synchronization method is the network time protocol proposed by Mills and Internet engineering task force group. A complete solution of the high-precision time-synchronization problem must reduce the randomness associated with the RTOS. The methods discussed in this article can help determine the frequency and time offset of a local time-of-day clock. The next challenge is to construct a local time-of-day clock and apply the synchronization information to it.","publicationTitle":"IEEE Control Systems","authors":["S.

The ensuing gain in throughput is moderated by the difficulty of efficiently programming such processors. Techniques for overcoming this difficulty are effective only for modest amounts of pipelining. This paper proposes applying an old but rarely used architectural approach to the design of single-chip signal processors so that the potential benefits of extensive pipelining can be fully realized. The architectural approach is to interleave multiple processes (or programs) through a single deeply pipelined processor in such a way that the disadvantages of deep pipelining disappear. Instead, the user is faced with the need to construct programs that can execute as concurrent processes. The main advantage is that much more pipelining can be used without aggravating the programming. A specific experimental architecture is outlined. The solution offered is a system solution in that architectural performance is considered along with programmability and ease of use. In the companion paper, data flow programming is suggested so that algorithms can be automatically partitioned for concurrent execution. Data flow provides a natural environment in which to build signal processing programs and can be supported efficiently in an architecture of the type described here.","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Acoustics, Speech, and Signal Processing","authors":["E.

Using a global, consistent notion of time, DE components communicate via time-stamped events. DE models have primarily been used in performance modeling and simulation, where time stamps are a modeling property bearing no relationship to real time during execution of the model. In this paper, we extend DE models with the capability of relating certain events to physical time. We propose a programming model, called PTIDES (programming temporally integrated distributed embedded systems), which has DE semantics, but with carefully chosen relations between model time and real time. Key to making this model effective is to ensure that constraints that guarantee determinacy in the semantics are preserved at runtime. To accomplish this, we give a distributed execution strategy that obeys DE semantics without the penalty of totally ordered executions based on time stamps. Our technique relies on having a distributed common notion of time, known to some precision. Based on causality analysis of DE models, we define relevant dependency and relevant orders to enable out-of-order execution without compromising determinism and without requiring backtracking","publicationTitle":"Real Time and Embedded Technology and Applications Symposium, 2007.

No matter how virtual walking is controlled, the generation of realistic virtual trajectories is absolutely required for some applications, especially those dedicated to the study of walking behaviors in VR, navigation through virtual places for architecture, rehabilitation and training. Previous studies focused on evaluating the realism of locomotion trajectories have mostly considered the result of the locomotion task (efficiency, accuracy) and its subjective perception (presence, cybersickness). Few focused on the locomotion trajectory itself, but in situation of geometrically constrained task. In this paper, we study the realism of unconstrained trajectories produced during virtual walking by addressing the following question: did the user reach his destination by virtually walking along a trajectory he would have followed in similar real conditions? To this end, we propose a comprehensive evaluation framework consisting on a set of trajectographical criteria and a locomotion model to generate reference trajectories. We consider a simple locomotion task where users walk between two oriented points in space. The travel path is analyzed both geometrically and temporally in comparison to simulated reference trajectories. In addition, we demonstrate the framework over a user study which considered an initial set of common and frequent virtual walking conditions, namely different input devices, output display devices, control laws, and visualization modalities. The study provides insight into the relative contributions of each condition to the overall realism of the resulting virtual trajectories.","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Visualization and Computer Graphics","references":{"1512020":{"upvotes":[],"downvotes":[],"id":"1512020","comments":[]},"5204082":{"upvotes":[],"downvotes":[],"id":"5204082","comments":[]},"4115591":{"upvotes":[],"downvotes":[],"id":"4115591","comments":[]},"5759212":{"upvotes":[],"downvotes":[],"id":"5759212","comments":[]},"6788040":{"upvotes":[],"downvotes":[],"id":"6788040","comments":[]},"1492762":{"upvotes":[],"downvotes":[],"id":"1492762","comments":[]},"4756020":{"upvotes":[],"downvotes":[],"id":"4756020","comments":[]},"1199309":{"upvotes":[],"downvotes":[],"id":"1199309","comments":[]},"6165135":{"upvotes":[],"downvotes":[],"id":"6165135","comments":[]},"6797599":{"upvotes":[],"downvotes":[],"id":"6797599","comments":[]},"6790789":{"upvotes":[],"downvotes":[],"id":"6790789","comments":[]}},"authors":["Gabriel Cirio","Anne-H\u0026#x00E9;l\u0026#x00E8;ne Olivier","Maud Marchal","Julien Pettr\u0026#x00E9;"],"link":"http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/6479208/","id":"6479208"},{"publicationYear":"2009","doi":"10.1109/MCG.2009.115","stream":"Mechanical Engineering","title":"Building on Realism and Magic for Designing 3D Interaction Techniques","abstract":"Imagination-based interaction can complement reality-based interaction in the design of 3D user interfaces.

The theoretical basis for the proposed SV metric and the algorithms for its implementation are presented. Data from two previous experiments on cybersickness were reanalyzed using the metric. Results showed that increasing SV by either increasing the scene complexity or scene velocity significantly increased the rated level of cybersickness. A strong correlation between SV and the level of cybersickness was found. The use of the spatial velocity metric to predict levels of cybersickness is also discussed.","publicationTitle":"Presence","authors":["Richard H. Y. So","Andy Ho","W. T.

The present study tests the validity of using sketch maps to examine aspects of virtual world cognitive maps. We predict that subjects who report feeling oriented within the virtual world will produce better sketch maps and so sketch-map accuracy can be used as an external measure of subject orientation and world knowledge. Results show a high positive correlation between subjective ratings of orientation, world knowledge and sketch-map accuracy, supporting our hypothesis that sketch maps provide a valid measure of internal cognitive maps of virtual environments. Results across different worlds also suggest that sketch maps can be used to find an absolute measure for goodness of world design.","publicationTitle":"Virtual Reality Annual International Symposium, 1995.

The traditional solution is to require the user to travel indirectly, using a device that changes his viewpoint in the environment without actually requiring him to move - for example, a joystick. However, other solutions involving variations on direct walking are also possible. In this paper, we present a new metaphor for natural, augmented direct locomotion through moderately large-scale immersive virtual environments (IVEs) presented via head mounted display systems, which we call seven league boots. The key characteristic of this method is that it involves determining a users intended direction of travel and then augmenting only the component of his or her motion that is aligned with that direction. After reviewing previously proposed methods for enabling intuitive locomotion through large IVEs, we begin by describing the technical implementation details of our novel method, discussing the various alternative options that we explored and parameters that we varied in an attempt to attain optimal performance. We then present the results of a pilot observer experiment that we conducted in an attempt to obtain objective, qualitative insight into the relative strengths and weaknesses of our new method, in comparison to the three most commonly used alternative locomotion methods: flying, via use of a wand; normal walking, with a uniform gain applied to the output of the tracker; and normal walking without gain, but with the location and orientation of the larger virtual environment periodically adjusted relative to position of the participant in the real environment. In this study we found, among other things, that for travel down a long, straight virtual hallway, participants overwhelmingly preferred the seven league boots method to the other methods, overall","publicationTitle":"3D User Interfaces, 2007. 3DUI '07.

However, until now the influence of stereoscopic vision on change blindness has not been studied thoroughly in the context of visual perception research. In this paper we introduce change blindness techniques for stereoscopic projection systems, providing the ability to substantially modify a virtual scene in a manner that is difficult for observers to perceive. We evaluate techniques for passive and active stereoscopic viewing and compare the results to those of monoscopic viewing conditions. For stereoscopic viewing conditions, we found that change blindness phenomena occur with the same magnitude as in monoscopic viewing conditions. Furthermore, we have evaluated the potential of the presented techniques for allowing abrupt, and yet significant, changes of a stereoscopically displayed virtual reality environment.","publicationTitle":"Virtual Reality Conference (VR), 2010 IEEE","authors":["Frank Steinicke","Gerd Bruder","Klaus Hinrichs","Pete Willemsen"],"link":"http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/5444790/","references":{"5072212":{"upvotes":[],"downvotes":[],"id":"5072212","comments":[]},"4297685":{"upvotes":[],"downvotes":[],"id":"4297685","comments":[]},"4811208":{"upvotes":[],"downvotes":[],"id":"4811208","comments":[]}},"id":"5444790"},{"publicationYear":"2010","doi":"10.1109/TVCG.2009.62","stream":"Mechanical Engineering","title":"Estimation of Detection Thresholds for Redirected Walking Techniques","abstract":"In immersive virtual environments (IVEs), users can control their virtual viewpoint by moving their tracked head and walking through the real world. Usually, movements in the real world are mapped one-to-one to virtual camera motions. With redirection techniques, the virtual camera is manipulated by applying gains to user motion so that the virtual world moves differently than the real world. Thus, users can walk through large-scale IVEs while physically remaining in a reasonably small workspace. In psychophysical experiments with a two-alternative forced-choice task, we have quantified how much humans can unknowingly be redirected on physical paths that are different from the visually perceived paths. We tested 12 subjects in three different experiments: (E1) discrimination between virtual and physical rotations, (E2) discrimination between virtual and physical straightforward movements, and (E3) discrimination of path curvature. In experiment E1, subjects performed rotations with different gains, and then had to choose whether the visually perceived rotation was smaller or greater than the physical rotation. In experiment E2, subjects chose whether the physical walk was shorter or longer than the visually perceived scaled travel distance. In experiment E3, subjects estimate the path curvature when walking a curved path in the real world while the visual display shows a straight path in the virtual world. Our results show that users can be turned physically about 49 percent more or 20 percent less than the perceived virtual rotation, distances can be downscaled by 14 percent and upscaled by 26 percent, and users can be redirected on a circular arc with a radius greater than 22 m while they believe that they are walking straight.","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Visualization and Computer Graphics","references":{"4476598":{"upvotes":[],"downvotes":[],"id":"4476598","comments":[]},"4161000":{"upvotes":[],"downvotes":[],"id":"4161000","comments":[]},"4142862":{"upvotes":[],"downvotes":[],"id":"4142862","comments":[]},"996517":{"upvotes":[],"downvotes":[],"id":"996517","comments":[]},"6797534":{"upvotes":[],"downvotes":[],"id":"6797534","comments":[]},"4160999":{"upvotes":[],"downvotes":[],"id":"4160999","comments":[]},"4480761":{"upvotes":[],"downvotes":[],"id":"4480761","comments":[]},"1667620":{"upvotes":[],"downvotes":[],"id":"1667620","comments":[]},"1492762":{"upvotes":[],"downvotes":[],"id":"1492762","comments":[]},"4741303":{"upvotes":[],"downvotes":[],"id":"4741303","comments":[]},"1492747":{"upvotes":[],"downvotes":[],"id":"1492747","comments":[]},"996544":{"upvotes":[],"downvotes":[],"id":"996544","comments":[]},"6790523":{"upvotes":[],"downvotes":[],"id":"6790523","comments":[]},"6790640":{"upvotes":[],"downvotes":[],"id":"6790640","comments":[]},"1510541":{"upvotes":[],"downvotes":[],"id":"1510541","comments":[]},"6790789":{"upvotes":[],"downvotes":[],"id":"6790789","comments":[]}},"authors":["Frank Steinicke","Gerd Bruder","Jason Jerald","Harald Frenz","Markus Lappe"],"link":"http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/5072212/","id":"5072212"},{"publicationYear":"2010","doi":"10.1109/3DUI.2010.5444726","stream":"Mechanical Engineering","title":"Effects of travel technique and gender on a divided attention task in a virtual environment","abstract":"We report a user study which compared four virtual environment travel techniques using a divided attention task. Participants used either real walking, gaze-directed, pointing-directed, or torso-directed travel to follow a target through an environment while simultaneously responding to auditory stimuli. In addition to travel technique, we investigated gender as a between-subjects variable and task difficulty (simple or complex) and task type (single or divided) as within-subjects variables. Real walking allowed superior performance over the pointing-directed technique on measures of navigation task performance and recognition of stimuli presented during navigation. This indicates that participants using real walking may have had more spare cognitive capacity to process and encode stimuli than those using pointing-directed travel. We also found a gender-difficulty interaction where males performed worse and responded slower to the attention task when the spatial task was more difficult, but no differences were observed for females between difficulty levels. While these results may be pertinent for the design of virtual environments, the nature and goal of the virtual environment tasks must be carefully considered to determine whether similar effects on performance can be expected under different conditions.","publicationTitle":"3D User Interfaces (3DUI), 2010 IEEE Symposium on","references":{"4476598":{"upvotes":[],"downvotes":[],"id":"4476598","comments":[]},"4142862":{"upvotes":[],"downvotes":[],"id":"4142862","comments":[]},"583043":{"upvotes":[],"downvotes":[],"id":"583043","comments":[]},"4142859":{"upvotes":[],"downvotes":[],"id":"4142859","comments":[]},"4297685":{"upvotes":[],"downvotes":[],"id":"4297685","comments":[]},"6788011":{"upvotes":[],"downvotes":[],"id":"6788011","comments":[]},"4145210":{"upvotes":[],"downvotes":[],"id":"4145210","comments":[]},"4811004":{"upvotes":[],"downvotes":[],"id":"4811004","comments":[]},"6788147":{"upvotes":[],"downvotes":[],"id":"6788147","comments":[]},"1492762":{"upvotes":[],"downvotes":[],"id":"1492762","comments":[]},"1046626":{"upvotes":[],"downvotes":[],"id":"1046626","comments":[]},"1512020":{"upvotes":[],"downvotes":[],"id":"1512020","comments":[]}},"authors":["Evan A.

In the first experiment, participants completed a non-branching multilevel 3D maze at their own pace using either real walking or one of two virtual travel techniques. In the second experiment, we constructed a real-world maze with branching pathways and modeled an identical virtual environment. Participants explored either the real or virtual maze for a predetermined amount of time using real walking or a virtual travel technique. Our results across experiments suggest that for complex environments requiring a large number of turns, virtual travel is an acceptable substitute for real walking if the goal of the application involves learning or reasoning based on information presented in the virtual world. However, for applications that require fast, efficient navigation or travel that closely resembles real-world behavior, real walking has advantages over common joystick-based virtual travel techniques.","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Visualization and Computer Graphics","references":{"4476598":{"upvotes":[],"downvotes":[],"id":"4476598","comments":[]},"4142861":{"upvotes":[],"downvotes":[],"id":"4142861","comments":[]},"583043":{"upvotes":[],"downvotes":[],"id":"583043","comments":[]},"1512020":{"upvotes":[],"downvotes":[],"id":"1512020","comments":[]},"4297685":{"upvotes":[],"downvotes":[],"id":"4297685","comments":[]},"6788011":{"upvotes":[],"downvotes":[],"id":"6788011","comments":[]},"6788147":{"upvotes":[],"downvotes":[],"id":"6788147","comments":[]},"1492762":{"upvotes":[],"downvotes":[],"id":"1492762","comments":[]},"756955":{"upvotes":[],"downvotes":[],"id":"756955","comments":[]},"6787999":{"upvotes":[],"downvotes":[],"id":"6787999","comments":[]},"1046626":{"upvotes":[],"downvotes":[],"id":"1046626","comments":[]},"512478":{"upvotes":[],"downvotes":[],"id":"512478","comments":[]},"4142859":{"upvotes":[],"downvotes":[],"id":"4142859","comments":[]}},"authors":["Evan Suma","Samantha Finkelstein","Myra Reid","Sabarish Babu","Amy Ulinski","Larry F.

At the university level, successful mechatronics programs have emerged that can serve as models representing the various ways that mechatronics can be taught. One such program at the undergraduate level is the multi-course guided curriculum in mechatronics that is available to students in their senior year in the Mechanical Engineering Department at the University of Washington. The culmination of this mechatronics thread is an intense, ten-week capstone design course in which students are organized into teams of three or four students each, with each team addressing a different significant, open-ended mechatronics project. Following a brief review of our mechatronics program as a whole, the curriculum into which it fits, and the individual constituent courses, described in this paper are our capstone design course and three typical projects from that course.","publicationTitle":"Advanced Intelligent Mechatronics, 1999.

It seems equally clear that that accepted definition of mechatronics is not being adequately implemented in the classroom. This paper addresses this issue, suggests probable reasons for it and describes a new course being developed at Boise State University which places a much stronger emphasis on mechanical design skills and practice than many mechatronics courses.","publicationTitle":"Advanced Intelligent Mechatronics, 2001.

Forms of individualized instruction leading up to multimedia instruction are described, and a review of the integration of individualized instruction into a standard education curriculum is included. Discussed is a jointly defined effort between IBM and the California State University at Fullerton that demonstrated: (1) the benefits of a parallel course-development and course-implementation approach, (2) the superiority of multimedia over traditional instruction in the subject area tested, and (3) very low-cost development of quality multimedia courses. A projection by IBM for its own internal education program indicates that by the year 2000 not only will individualized instruction become fully integrated into IBMs education curriculum, but it will become the dominant approach, encompassing within it many aspects of traditional instruction. The continuing integration of individualized instruction with other technologies and advances in digital full-motion capabilities can help make multimedia instruction not only independent of time and place, but more engrossing and enjoyable as well.","publicationTitle":"IBM Systems Journal","references":{},"authors":["S.

The obvious assignment, a group programming project, proved to be a poor choice when implemented in the authors computer graphics class. An examination of the literature in this area shows that a group programming project has many features in common with a group term paper, the assignment which has been uniquely identified as the worst choice for small group work. Fortunately, there are better choices for cooperative learning in computer science. Assignments with the three Ss: same problem, specific choice and simultaneous reporting of group choices, work well. This was implemented in a class by having students work multiple choice quizzes designed to require high level learning skills. Quizzes were first worked by individuals, then by small groups. The small group answers are then compared and discussed in class. This generates the type of interaction between the professor and students which creates positive cooperative learning experiences. Promising preliminary results have been seen with this method, from both the student and the professors perspective.","publicationTitle":"Frontiers in Education Conference, 1999.

Image processing and control of the car are accomplished by a personal computer (PC). The road image captured by the camera is transmitted to a PC via a transmitter-receiver pair at 900 MHz. A frame grabber board digitizes the image, and an image-processing program subsequently analyzes the road condition and generates adequate drive commands that are transmitted back to the vehicle via the built-in radio controller. Student teams write programs to compete in racing or maze solving. In this paper detailed hardware and software designs of the project are presented.

Current humanoid robots, however, lack in adaptability, agility, or high-mobility enough to meet the expectations. In order to enhance high-mobility, the humanoid motion should be generated in real-time in accordance with the dynamics, which commonly requires a large amount of computation and has not been implemented so far. We have developed a real-time motion generation method that controls the center of gravity (COG) by indirect manipulation of the zero moment point (ZMP). The real-time response of the method provides humanoid robots with high-mobility. In the paper, the algorithm is presented. It consists of four parts, namely, the referential ZMP planning, the ZMP manipulation, the COG velocity decomposition to joint angles, and local control of joint angles. An advantage of the algorithm lies in its applicability to humanoids with a lot of degrees of freedom. The effectiveness of the proposed method is verified by computer simulations.","publicationTitle":"Robotics and Automation, 2002. Proceedings. ICRA '02.

A basic premise of the inverted classroom model is that richer open-ended problem solving experiences can be conducted within the classroom environment.

Since poor teaching has been shown to contribute to student attrition from engineering, studying the beliefs and practices of faculty who are committed to teaching may provide ideas of how to improve engineering education in general. For this study, interviews were conducted with twenty-six engineering educators at FIE06. Participants were asked to describe what they believed were effective teaching practices. Next, participants were asked to consider a list of teaching practices and rank these according to what they believed were most effective and which they actually utilized.

Other results highlight the most common student misconceptions and quantify the correlation between signals and systems and prerequisite courses.","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Education","references":{"1263392":{"upvotes":[],"downvotes":[],"id":"1263392","comments":[]},"790976":{"upvotes":[],"downvotes":[],"id":"790976","comments":[]},"790977":{"upvotes":[],"downvotes":[],"id":"790977","comments":[]},"1437911":{"upvotes":[],"downvotes":[],"id":"1437911","comments":[]},"1406489":{"upvotes":[],"downvotes":[],"id":"1406489","comments":[]},"4725852":{"upvotes":[],"downvotes":[],"id":"4725852","comments":[]},"1495653":{"upvotes":[],"downvotes":[],"id":"1495653","comments":[]},"963689":{"upvotes":[],"downvotes":[],"id":"963689","comments":[]}},"authors":["K.E.

To cope with the huge quantity of voxels and still perform in real-time, two special features were incorporated within the architecture: a unique skewed memory organization, which permits the retrieval and storage of voxels in parallel, and a multiple-write bus, which speeds up the viewing process. These features allow Cube, for example, to project an image of n/sup 3/ voxels in O(n/sup 2/ log n) time rather than the conventional O(n/sup 3/) time.","publicationTitle":"IEEE Computer Graphics and Applications","references":{"4055950":{"upvotes":[],"downvotes":[],"id":"4055950","comments":[]},"6429335":{"upvotes":[],"downvotes":[],"id":"6429335","comments":[]},"1674403":{"upvotes":[],"downvotes":[],"id":"1674403","comments":[]},"4056038":{"upvotes":[],"downvotes":[],"id":"4056038","comments":[]},"4037561":{"upvotes":[],"downvotes":[],"id":"4037561","comments":[]}},"authors":["A.

The actual locations of the underground transmitters in each case were projected to the surface using mine maps and conventional surveying techniques. A crossed loop direction finding receiver was developed to respond to the magnetic field. A null in the horizontal magnetic field was used to identify the surface location directly above the transmitter. Evaluation of this system at five locations in the four mines revealed location errors of 13 meters, 7 meters, 3 meters, 2 meters and 0. 5 meters respectively. Theoretical computations of magnetic field strengths based on transmitter frequency, ground conductivity and transmitter depth are shown along with measured profiles for two of the four mines visited. The effects of uniformly sloping terrain and dipole tilt are also examined theoretically and the results are shown to be consistent with the field measurements made under these conditions. Using known theoretical corrections for hill slope, it is shown that the measured source location can be improved to where it is within three meters of the actual location.","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Geoscience Electronics","authors":["R.

In particular, we give a more intuitive derivation of the bound as a function of the number of harmonic chains in the task periods which allows us to derive a simpler algorithm to calculate such bounds.

Furthermore, the DASH system does not contain any single serialization or control point. While these features provide the basis for scalability, they also force a reevaluation of many fundamental issues involved in the design of a protocol.

Using this approach, the system can be seen as a two-level hierarchical scheduler. A considerable amount of work has been recently addressed to the analysis of this kind of hierarchical systems. However, a question is still unanswered: given a set of real-time tasks to be handled by a server, how to assign the server parameters so that the task set is feasible?

Tasks within the same task group are scheduled by an application-task-level scheduler that is specialized to the real-time requirements of the tasks in the group. An ideal goal for resource partitioning in real-time systems is to achieve a complete separation of concerns so that: (1) each task group may be executed as if it had access to its own dedicated resource, and (2) there is minimal interaction between the resource-level scheduler and the application-task-level scheduler. In [15], we introduced the notion of a real-time virtual resource which operates at a fraction of the rate of the shared physical resource and whose rate of operation varies with time but is bounded. In this paper we discuss an approach to bound the variation of the rate of operation of a real-time virtual resource by characterizing the rate variation from both temporal and supply dimensions and by expanding on the concept of regularity that was first introduced in [19]. For the case of regular resource partitioning, we show that the utilization bounds of both fixed-priority scheduling and dynamic-priority scheduling remain unchanged from those for dedicated resources. We determine the utilization bounds for the more general case of irregular partitioning.

In a 2001 paper, we introduced the notion of a real-time virtual resource which operates at a fraction of the rate of the shared physical resource and whose rate of service provision varies with time but is bounded. The shared resource is partitioned into real-time virtual resources by a resource-level scheduler such that each real-time virtual resource is accessible only by an individual application task group; tasks within the same task group are scheduled by an application-task-level scheduler that is specialized to the real-time requirements of the tasks in the group. In this paper we propose a hierarchical real-time virtual resource model that permits resource partitioning to be extended to multiple levels. Through this model, partitions on each level are scheduled as if they had access to a dedicated resource and there is minimal interference between neighboring partition levels. We also investigate the partitioning of real-time virtual resources subject to scheduling quantum requirements.","publicationTitle":"Real-Time Systems Symposium, 2002.

In this paper we describe a system of guarantees that permits a general hierarchy of soft real-time schedulers one that contains arbitrary scheduling algorithms at all points within the hierarchy - to be analyzed. This analysis results in deterministic guarantees for threads at the leaves of the hierarchy. We also describe the design, implementation, and performance evaluation of a system for supporting such a hierarchy in the Windows 2000 kernel.

However, they lack many of the modularity and abstraction mechanisms that programmers have become accustomed to in 00 languages, such as classes, inheritance, interfaces, and polymorphism. This extended abstract shows the form that such mechanisms might take in AO languages. A prototype of these mechanisms realized in Ptolemy II is described.","publicationTitle":"Formal Methods and Models for Co-Design, 2004. MEMOCODE '04. Proceedings.

It describes concurrent processes in general terms as sets of possible behaviors. A process is determinate if, given the constraints imposed by the inputs, there are exactly one or exactly zero behaviors. Compositions of processes are processes with behaviors in the intersection of the behaviors of the component processes. The interaction between processes is through signals, which are collections of events. Each event is a value-tag pair, where the tags can come from a partially ordered or totally ordered set. Timed models are where the set of tags is totally ordered. Synchronous events share the same tag, and synchronous signals contain events with the same set of tags. Synchronous processes have only synchronous signals as behaviors. Strict causality (in timed tag systems) and continuity (in untimed tag systems) ensure determinacy under certain technical conditions. The framework is used to compare certain essential features of various models of computation, including Kahn process networks, dataflow, sequential processes, concurrent sequential processes with rendezvous, Petri nets, and discrete-event systems.","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Computer-Aided Design of Integrated Circuits and Systems","authors":["E.A.

The second determines an operation of the ALU on the contents of local registers. A fast free-running multiplier operates in parallel with the ALU and delivers a product in every cycle with a pipeline delay of two cycles. The architecture allows transversal-filter operations to be performed with one multiplication and ALU operation in every cycle. This is accomplished by a novel interleaving technique called ZIP-ing.

If a special-purpose VLSI chip is designed for a particular signal processing task, such as FIR filtering, for example, the maximum clock rate, and hence throughput, is determined by the depth of the combinational logic between registers and the time required for the distribution and operation of the clock. If the combinational logic is sufficiently deep (in bit-parallel circuits, for example), the throughput can be increased by inserting intermediate stages of clocked latches. This is at the expense of increased area and delay to operate and clock the intermediate registers. Roughly speaking, the strategy amounts to using more of the chip area to store information useful for pipelining. This paper investigates the optimal tradeoff between the degree of intermediate latching and cost, using the measure AP, where A is the chip area and P is the period (the reciprocal of throughput). We derive expressions for the time and area before and after intermediate latching, using the Mead-Conway model, both for the cases of on-chip and off-chip clock drivers. The results show that significant reductions in AP product (reciprocal of throughput per unit area) can be achieved by intermediate latching in many typical signal processing applications, for a wide range of circuit parameters. The array multiplier is used as an example.","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Acoustics, Speech, and Signal Processing","references":{"1164165":{"upvotes":[],"downvotes":[],"id":"1164165","comments":[]},"1585417":{"upvotes":[],"downvotes":[],"id":"1585417","comments":[]},"4568313":{"upvotes":[],"downvotes":[],"id":"4568313","comments":[]}},"authors":["P.

These factors explicitly consider information about real-time constraints of tasks and their utilization of resources. Simulation studies show that the weights for the various factors in the heuristic function have to be fine-tuned in order to obtain a degree of success in the range of 75-88 percent of that obtained via exhaustive search. However, modifying the approach to use limited backtracking improves the degree of success substantially to as high as 99.5 percent. This improvement is observed even when the initial set of weights are not tailored for a particular set of tasks. Simulation studies also show that in most cases the schedule determined by the heuristic algorithm is optimal or close to optimal.","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Software Engineering","authors":[" Wei Zhao","K.

We have defined new performance measures for real-time controller computers based on this coupling. We present a systematic study of a typical critical controlled process in the context of new performance measures that express the performance of both controlled processes and controller computers (taken as a unit) on the basis of a single variable: controller response time. Controller response time is a function of current system state, system failure rate, electrical and/or magnetic interference, etc., and is therefore a random variable. Control overhead is expressed as monotonically nondecreasing function of the response time and the system suffers catastrophic failure, or dynamic failure, if the response time for a control task exceeds the corresponding system hard deadline, if any. The controlled-process chosen for study is an aircraft in the final stages of descent, just prior to landing. Control constraints are particularly severe during this period, and great care must be taken in the design of controllers that handle this process. First, the performance measures for the controller are presented.

This optimization is a difficult problem, and heuristics and designer judgment are called for in the process. The chief cause of the difficulty is the large number of parameters under the designers control which impact performance and life-cycle cost. We study the interplay between the more important parameters in this paper using two objective measures, i. e., the mean cost and the probability of dynamic failure in [6], [10]. Among these are the processor burn-in time and processor replacement policy. A central feature of this work is a look at how the application requirements affect the optimality of the distributed systems; indeed, the application requirements are an integral part of the analysis.","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Computers","authors":["C.

In contrast to a component description that describes what a component does, a component interface describes how a component can be used, and a well designed component interface provides enough information to decide whether two or more components can work together properly in a system. Real-Time Interfaces expand the idea of interfacebased design to the area of real-time system design, where the term of working together properly refers to questions like: Does the composed system satisfy all requested real-time properties such as delay and throughput constraints? In this work, we extend the theory of Real-Time Interfaces and prove its applicability for the design of systems with hierarchical scheduling. We introduce a component system for interface-based design of systems with mixed FP, RM and EDF scheduling. We then further extend the ability for hierarchic scheduling by introducing server components. The introduced component system with Real-Time Interfaces not only allows interface-based design of complex real-time systems with hierarchical scheduling, but also inherently enables detailed schedulability analysis of such systems.","publicationTitle":"Real-Time and Embedded Technology and Applications Symposium, 2006.

This rule is easy to implement and has strong intuitive appeal. Given a finite sequence with an arbitrary initial condition, the rule is also optimal, in the sense that it minimizes the width of the marginal confidence interval about the truncated sample mean. We illustrate the performance of the rule by applying it to output generated by multiple runs of four queueing simulations. Models and run conditions provide the test sequences for which truncation is contraindicated, test sequences exhibiting positive and negative initialization bias, and test sequences which are entirely transient. Results demonstrate that the rule is efficient, effective, and consistent with the conflicting objectives of mitigating initialization bias while preserving information.","publicationTitle":"Systems, Man, and Cybernetics, 1994.

Among all the possible trajectories reaching a given goal what are the fundamental reasons to chose one trajectory instead of another? The underlying idea to attack this question has been to relate this problem to an optimal control problem: the trajectory is chosen according to some optimization principle. This is our basic starting assumption. The subject being viewed as a controlled system, the question becomes what criteria is optimized? Is it the time to perform the trajectory? the length of the path? the minimum jerk along the path?... In this study we show that the human locomotor trajectories are well approximated by the geodesics of a differential system minimizing the L\u003csub\u003e2\u003c/sub\u003e norm of the control. Such geodesics are made of arcs of clothoids. The clothoid or Cornu spiral is a curve, whose curvature grows with the distance from the origin. The study is based on an experimental protocol involving 7 subjects. They had to walk within a motion capture room from a fixed starting point, and to cross over distant porches from which both position in the room and orientation were changing over trials.","publicationTitle":"Humanoid Robots, 2006 6th IEEE-RAS International Conference on","authors":["Gustavo Arechavaleta","Jean-paul Laumond","Halim Hicheur","Alain Berthoz"],"link":"http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/4115591/","references":{"1100365":{"upvotes":[],"downvotes":[],"id":"1100365","comments":[]},"1639077":{"upvotes":[],"downvotes":[],"id":"1639077","comments":[]},"280745":{"upvotes":[],"downvotes":[],"id":"280745","comments":[]}},"id":"4115591"},{"publicationYear":"2005","doi":"10.1162/105474605774785262","stream":"Mechanical Engineering","title":"The Perception of Walking Speed in a Virtual Environment","abstract":"Studies of locomotion in virtual environments assume that correct geometric principles define the relationship between walking speed and environmental flow. However, we have observed that geometrically correct optic flow appears to be too slow during simulated locomotion on a treadmill. Experiment 1 documents the effect in a head-mounted display. Experiment 2 shows that the effect is eliminated when the gaze is directed downward or to the side, or when the walking speed is slow. Experiment 3 shows that the effect is unchanged by stride length. Experiment 4 verifies that the effect is not attributable to image jitter. The change in perceived speed from straight ahead to side or down gaze coincides with a shift from expanding optic flow to lamellar flow. Therefore, we hypothesize that lamellar flow is necessary for accurate speed perception, and that a limited field of view eliminates this cue during straight-ahead gaze.","publicationTitle":"Presence","authors":["Tom Banton","Jeanine Stefanucci","Frank Durgin","Adam Fass","Dennis Proffitt"],"link":"http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/6790789/","references":{},"id":"6790789"},{"publicationYear":"2003","doi":"10.1109/CASA.2003.1199309","stream":"Mechanical Engineering","title":"Realistic human walking paths","abstract":"Pedestrian navigation is a complex function of human dynamics, a desired destination, and the presence of obstacles.

In this paper, we propose three novel locomotion techniques that have three concurrent goals: keep the user safe from reaching the translational and rotational boundaries; increase the amount of real walking and finally, provide a more enjoyable and ecological interaction paradigm compared to traditional controller-based approaches. We notably introduce the Virtual Companion, which uses a small bird to guide the user through VEs larger than the physical space. We evaluate the three new techniques through a user study with travel-to-target and path following tasks. The study provides insight into the relative strengths of each new technique for the three aforementioned goals. Specifically, if speed and accuracy are paramount, traditional controller interfaces augmented with our novel warning techniques may be more appropriate; if physical walking is more important, two of our paradigms (extended Magic Barrier Tape and Constrained Wand) should be preferred; last, fun and ecological criteria would favor the Virtual Companion.","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Visualization and Computer Graphics","authors":["Gabriel Cirio","Peter Vangorp","Emmanuelle Chapoulie","Maud Marchal","Anatole Lecuyer","George Drettakis"],"link":"http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/6165135/","references":{"4142862":{"upvotes":[],"downvotes":[],"id":"4142862","comments":[]},"6797534":{"upvotes":[],"downvotes":[],"id":"6797534","comments":[]},"4811213":{"upvotes":[],"downvotes":[],"id":"4811213","comments":[]},"6787999":{"upvotes":[],"downvotes":[],"id":"6787999","comments":[]},"4811208":{"upvotes":[],"downvotes":[],"id":"4811208","comments":[]},"6797345":{"upvotes":[],"downvotes":[],"id":"6797345","comments":[]},"6790523":{"upvotes":[],"downvotes":[],"id":"6790523","comments":[]},"1512020":{"upvotes":[],"downvotes":[],"id":"1512020","comments":[]},"4480761":{"upvotes":[],"downvotes":[],"id":"4480761","comments":[]}},"id":"6165135"},{"publicationYear":"1999","doi":"10.1162/105474699566503","stream":"Mechanical Engineering","title":"Path Reproduction Tests Using a Torus Treadmill","abstract":"This paper describes experiments regarding navigation performance using a new locomotion interface for walking through virtual space.

An intriguing possibility is that enhanced 3D interfaces might offer simpler navigation, more compelling functionality, safer movements, and less occlusion, than 3D reality, especially for information exploration and visualization tasks. Such features can enable superhuman capabilities such as faster-than-light teleportation, flying through objects, and X-ray vision.

Our approach emphasizes the close relationship between the shape of the locomotor paths in goal-directed movements and the simplified kinematic model of a wheeled mobile robot. This kind of system has been extensively studied in robotics community. From a kinematic perspective, the characteristic of this wheeled robot is the nonholonomic constraint of the wheels on the floor, which forces the vehicle to move tangentially to its main axis. Humans do not walk sideways. This obvious observation indicates that some constraints (mechanical, anatomical...) act on human bodies restricting the way humans generate locomotor trajectories. To model this, we propose a differential system that respects nonholonomic constraints. We validate this model by comparing simulated trajectories with actual (recorded) trajectories produced during goal-oriented locomotion in humans. Subjects had to start from a pre-defined position and direction to cross over a distant porch (position and orientation of the porch were the two manipulated factors). Such comparative analysis is undertaken by making use of numerical methods to compute the control inputs from actual trajectories. Three body frames have been considered: head, pelvis and trunk. It appears that the trunk can be considered as a kind of a steering wheel that steers the human body with a delay of around 0.2 second. This model has been validated on a database of 1,560 trajectories recorded from seven subjects.

A simple model of camera motion is first proposed. This model uses: (1) oscillating motions for the position of the camera, and (2) a compensation motion which changes the orientation of the camera and simulate oculomotor compensation to keep a constant focal point when walking. Then we describe two experiments which were conducted to study the characteristics of our model and the preference of the users in terms of sensation of walking. The first experiment compared the use of oscillating camera motions along the three directions of space. The oscillating motions were all preferred to the control condition (i.e. a linear motion, as if the user was driving a car). Furthermore, the participants preferred oscillating motions along the vertical axis, compared with the two other directions of space. The second experiment was focused on the use of a compensation motion. It showed that on average participants preferred a compensated motion during the walk, as compared with a motion with a constant orientation of the camera. These results are consistent with the way our body and eyes move naturally when walking in real life. Taken together, our results suggest that camera motions can considerably improve the sensation of walking in virtual environments. Camera motions could be further introduced in numerous applications of virtual reality in which the simulation of walking is important, such as: architectural visits, training simulations, or videogames.","publicationTitle":"Virtual Reality Conference, 2006","authors":["A.

While walking freely around in the user environment, the user sees the remote environment through the \u0026#8220;eyes\u0026#8221; of a remote mobile teleoperator. For that purpose, the users motion is tracked and transferred to the teleoperator. Without additional processing of the motion data, the size of the remote environment to be explored is limited to the size of the user environment. This paper proposes an extension of telepresent walking to arbitrarily large remote or virtual spaces based on compressing wide-area motion into the available user space. Motion compression is a novel approach and does not make use of scaling or walking-in-place metaphors. Rather, motion compression introduces some deviation of curvature between user motion and teleoperator motion. An optimization approach is used to find the user path of minimum curvature deviation with respect to a given predicted teleoperator path that fits inside the boundaries of the user environment.

In recent experiments (Interrante et al., 2006), we have found that participants appear less prone to significantly underestimate egocentric distances in HMD-based IVEs, relative to in the real world, in the special case that they unambiguously know, through first-hand observation, that the presented virtual environment is a high fidelity 3D model of their concurrently occupied real environment. We had hypothesized that this increased veridicality might be due to participants having a stronger sensation of presence in the IVE under these conditions of co-location, which state of mind leads them to act on their visual input in the IVE similarly as they would in the real world (the presence hypothesis). However, alternative hypotheses are also possible. Primary among these is the visual calibration hypothesis: participants could be relying on metric information gleaned from their exposure to the real environment to calibrate their judgments of sizes and distances in the matched virtual environment. It is important to disambiguate between the presence and visual calibration hypotheses because they suggest different directions for efforts to facilitate veridical distance perception in general (non-co-located) IVEs. In this paper, we present the results of an experiment that seeks novel insight into this question. Using a mixed within- and between-subjects design, we compare participants relative ability to accurately estimate egocentric distances in three different virtual environment models: one that is an identical match to the occupied real environment; one in which each of the walls in our virtual room model has been surreptitiously moved ~10% inward towards the center of the room; and one in which each of the walls has been surreptitiously moved ~10% outwards from the center of the room. If the visual calibration hypothesis holds, then we should expect to see a degradation in the accuracy of peoples distance judgments in the surreptitiously modified models, manifested as an underestimation of distances when the IVE is actually larger than the real room and as an overestimation of distances when the IVE is smaller. However, what we found is that distances were significantly underestimated in the virtual environment relative to in the real world in each of the surreptitiously modified room environments, while remaining reasonably accurate (consistent with our previous findings) in the case of the faithfully size-matched room environment. In a post-test survey, participants in each of the three room size conditions reported equivalent subjective levels of presence and did not indicate any overt awareness of the room size manipulation","publicationTitle":"Virtual Reality Conference, 2007.

We define an effectiveness measure for a cells-and-portals partitioning, and introduce a two-pass algorithm that computes a cells-and-portals partition. The algorithm uses a simple heuristic that creates short portals as a mean for generating an effective partition. The input to the algorithm is a set of half edges in 2D that can be extracted from a complex polygonal model. The first pass of the algorithm creates an initial partition, which is then refined by the second pass. We show that our method creates a partition that is more effective than the common BSP partition, even when the latter is further refined with the application of our second pass. Our cells-and-portals algorithm is designed to deal with arbitrarily oriented walls. The algorithm also supports outdoor scenes, where the vertical walls of the buildings served as occluders and portals are extended above the buildings. We show that the extended portals allow an output-sensitive rendering of large urban scenes. Finally, since our two-pass method is fully automatic and local, it supports incremental changes of the model by locally recomputing and updating the partition. We call our method Breaking the Walls (BW) since it breaks out of indoor scenes to outdoor scenes, and allows walls to be broken interactively, with an instant updating of the partition.","publicationTitle":"Computer Graphics and Applications, 2003.

However, the size of the virtual world often exceeds the size of the tracked space so that a straightforward implementation of omni-directional and unlimited walking is not possible. Redirected walking is one concept to solve this problem of walking in IVEs by inconspicuously guiding the user on a physical path that may differ from the path the user visually perceives. When the user approaches a virtual object she can be redirected to a real proxy object that is registered to the virtual counterpart and provides passive haptic feedback. In such passive haptic environments, any number of virtual objects can be mapped to proxy objects having similar haptic properties, e.g., size, shape and texture. The user can sense a virtual object by touching its real world counterpart. Redirecting a user to a registered proxy object makes it necessary to predict the users intended position in the IVE. Based on this target position we determine a path through the physical space such that the user is guided to the registered proxy object. We present a taxonomy of possible redirection techniques that enable user guidance such that inconsistencies between visual and proprioceptive stimuli are imperceptible.We describe how a users target in the virtual world can be predicted reliably and how a corresponding real-world path to the registered proxy object can be derived.","publicationTitle":"Cyberworlds, 2008 International Conference on","authors":["Frank Steinicke","Gerd Bruder","Luv Kohli","Jason Jerald","Klaus Hinrichs"],"link":"http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/4741303/","references":{"4476598":{"upvotes":[],"downvotes":[],"id":"4476598","comments":[]},"4161000":{"upvotes":[],"downvotes":[],"id":"4161000","comments":[]},"4142862":{"upvotes":[],"downvotes":[],"id":"4142862","comments":[]},"583043":{"upvotes":[],"downvotes":[],"id":"583043","comments":[]},"6797534":{"upvotes":[],"downvotes":[],"id":"6797534","comments":[]},"4160999":{"upvotes":[],"downvotes":[],"id":"4160999","comments":[]},"1667620":{"upvotes":[],"downvotes":[],"id":"1667620","comments":[]},"4145210":{"upvotes":[],"downvotes":[],"id":"4145210","comments":[]},"1492747":{"upvotes":[],"downvotes":[],"id":"1492747","comments":[]},"996544":{"upvotes":[],"downvotes":[],"id":"996544","comments":[]},"6790523":{"upvotes":[],"downvotes":[],"id":"6790523","comments":[]},"380761":{"upvotes":[],"downvotes":[],"id":"380761","comments":[]},"799737":{"upvotes":[],"downvotes":[],"id":"799737","comments":[]},"1510541":{"upvotes":[],"downvotes":[],"id":"1510541","comments":[]},"4480761":{"upvotes":[],"downvotes":[],"id":"4480761","comments":[]}},"id":"4741303"},{"publicationYear":"2009","doi":"10.1109/VR.2009.4811024","stream":"Mechanical Engineering","title":"Does a Gradual Transition to the Virtual World increase Presence?","abstract":"In order to increase a users sense of presence in an artificial environment some researchers propose a gradual transition from reality to the virtual world instead of immersing users into the virtual world directly.

Although this procedure is already applied in VR demonstrations, until now it has not been verified whether the usage of such a transitional environment - as transition between real and virtual environment - increases someones sense of presence. We have observed subjective, physiological and behavioral reactions of subjects during a fully-immersive flight phobia experiment under two different conditions: the virtual flight environment was displayed immediately, or subjects visited a transitional environment before entering the virtual flight environment. We have quantified to what extent a gradual transition to the VE via a transitional environment increases the level of presence. We have found that subjective responses show significantly higher scores for the users sense of presence, and that subjects behavioral reactions change when a transitional environment is shown first. Considering physiological reactions, no significant difference could be found.","publicationTitle":"Virtual Reality Conference, 2009. VR 2009.

The most intuitive way to move about the real world is to travel on foot. People often feel a better sense of distance or direction while walking than while riding in a vehicle. This article discusses the development of a locomotion device that provides a sense of walking. In terms of natural interaction, the physical exertion of walking proves essential to locomotion. The research of my colleagues and I aims to give users a sense of walking while their position remains localized in the physical world. Weve developed several prototypes of interface devices for walking. From the results of our research, we concluded that an infinite surface would offer an ideal means for giving people a sense of walking. Our device, called the Torus Treadmill, uses a torus-shaped surface to realize the locomotion interface. The surface employs 12 sets of treadmills connected side-by-side and driven in a perpendicular direction. These treadmills generate an infinite surface. We measured the motion of the users feet with magnetic sensors. The floor moves in the opposite direction of the walker, canceling the motion of each step. The walkers position remains localized in the real world by this computer-controlled motion of the floor. The walker can freely change direction.

The goal is to allow the user to move through virtual environments in as similar a manner as possible to walking through the real world. We approach this problem by examining the interrelationships between motion control and the other actions people use to act, sense, and react to their environment. If the interactions between control actions and sensory feedback can be made comparable to those of actions in the real world, then there is hope for constructing an effective new technique. Candidate solutions are reviewed once the analysis is developed. This analysis leads to a promising new design for a sensor-based virtual locomotion called \u003citalic\u003eGaiter.\u003c/italic\u003e The new control allows users to direct their movement through virtual environments by stepping in place. The movement of a persons legs is sensed, and in-place walking is treated as a gesture indicating the user intends to take a virtual step. More specifically, the movement of the users legs determines the direction, extent, and timing of their movement through virtual environments. Tying virtual locomotion to leg motion allows a person to step in any direction and control the stride length and cadence of his virtual steps. The user can walk straight, turn in place, and turn while advancing. Motion is expressed in a body-centric coordinate system similar to that of actual stepping. The system can discriminate between gestural and actual steps, so both types of steps can be intermixed.","publicationTitle":"Presence","references":{},"authors":["James N. Templeman","Patricia S.

In order to ensure a high degree of telepresence realism, it is critical that the local user has the ability to control the remote agents movement through the users own locomotion. The required motion of the remote agent is determined according to its environment and the specific task it is to perform. The local users environment is usually different from that of the remote agent in terms of the shapes and dimensions. A motion mapping is needed from the remote agent to the local user to ensure the similarity of the paths in the two environments. In particular, the terminal position of the local user after a segment of movement is also an important portion in such a motion mapping. This paper progressively addresses these issues from the optimization point of view. Two strategies are suggested for solving the motion mapping problem for the single user case. The resulting solutions are then extended to the multiuser case where several local users share a local environment to control different remote agents. Extensive simulations and comparisons show the feasibility and effectiveness of the proposed approaches.","publicationTitle":"Presence","references":{},"authors":["Jianbo Su"],"link":"http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/6797534/","id":"6797534"},{"publicationYear":"2000","doi":"10.1162/105474600566574","stream":"Mechanical Engineering","title":"Inertial-Force Feedback for the Treadport Locomotion Interface","abstract":"The inertial force due to the acceleration of a locomotion interface is identified as a difference between virtual and real-world locomotion.

Their task was to indicate the direction to these target objects from a terminal location in the maze (from which the objects could no longer be seen). Subjects controlled their motion through the mazes using three locomotion modes. In the Walk mode, subjects walked normally in the experimental room. For each subject, body position and heading were tracked, and the tracking information was used to continuously update the visual imagery presented to the subjects on a head-mounted display. This process created the impression of immersion in the experimental maze. In the Visual Turn mode subjects moved through the environment using a joystick to control their turning. The only sensory information subjects received about rotation and translation was that provided by the computer-generated imagery. The Real Turn mode was midway between the other two modes, in that subjects physically turned in place to steer while translating in the virtual maze; thus translation through the maze was signaled only by the computer-generated imagery, whereas rotations were signaled by the imagery as well as by proprioceptive and vestibular information. The dependent measure in the experiment was the absolute error of the subjects directional estimate to each target from the terminal location. Performance in the Walk mode was significantly better than in the Visual Turn mode but other trends were not significant. A secondary finding was that the degree of motion sickness depended upon locomotion mode, with the lowest incidence occurring in the Walk mode. Both findings suggest the advisability of having subjects explore virtual environments using real rotations and translations in tasks involving spatial orientation.","publicationTitle":"Presence","authors":["Sarah S.

How significant are these distortions for spatial perception in virtual reality? In this study, we used a helmet-mounted display and a mechanical head tracker to investigate the tolerance to errors between head motions and the resulting visual display. The relationship between the head movement and the associated updating of the visual display was adjusted by subjects until the image was judged as stable relative to the world. Both rotational and translational movements were tested, and the relationship between the movements and the direction of gravity was varied systematically. Typically, for the display to be judged as stable, subjects needed the visual world to be moved in the opposite direction to the head movement by an amount greater than the head movement itself, during both rotational and translational head movements, although a large range of movement was tolerated and judged as appearing stable. These results suggest that it not necessary to model the visual geometry accurately and suggest circumstances when tracker drift can be corrected by jumps in the display which will pass unnoticed by the user.","publicationTitle":"Virtual Reality, 2002.

In psychological experiments, such disorientation is often compensated for by extensive training. The current study investigated participants sense of direction by means of a rapid point-to-origin task without any training or performance feedback. This allowed us to study participants intuitive spatial orientation in VR while minimizing the influence of higher cognitive abilities and compensatory strategies. After visually displayed passive excursions along one-or two-segment trajectories, participants were asked to point back to the origin of locomotion as accurately and quickly as possible. Despite using a high-quality video projection with a 84deg times 63deg field of view, participants overall performance was rather poor. Moreover, six of the 16 participants exhibited striking qualitative errors, i.e., consistent left-right confusions that have not been observed in comparable real world experiments. Taken together, this study suggests that even an immersive high-quality video projection system is not necessarily sufficient for enabling natural spatial orientation in VR. We propose that a rapid point-to-origin paradigm can be a useful tool for evaluating and improving the effectiveness of VR setups in terms of enabling natural and unencumbered spatial orientation and performance.","publicationTitle":"Virtual Reality Conference, 2007.

ROSUB 6000 system consists of a free swimming ROV, tether management system (TMS), power container, control console container, Launching and retrieval system (LARS) and electro optical umbilical cable. Developmental work of ROSUB 6000 system started from March 2003. During the developmental phase and several depth qualification sea trials various kinds of mechanical engineering challenges were encountered. This paper enumerates the challenges encountered. Water entry is one of the major challenges in subsea systems. Water entry through pressure housings may be catastrophic, since pressure housings carries control electronics. Control electronics switches off when water entry alarm is given stopping all the ROV operations. Water entry in the pressure cases of ROV has happened several times. Each instance the reason behind the water entry was different. Failure of components like torque arrester in TMS deep sea winch and thruster frames were analyzed and suitable methodologies to avoid these failures are brought into the practice. Challenges in deck handling of ROV and TMS are weather conditions and tether twist during initial attachment of ROV with TMS. One another big challenge is the launching and retrieval of the system. Challenges due to rough seas, launching and retrieval system hydraulic system faults, operational human errors and their effects on the system components are recorded and reviewed to improve the system reliability. The importance of buoyancy corrections and hydraulic system maintenance were learnt during the various phases of lab and field testing of the deep water ROV.","publicationTitle":"Underwater Technology (UT), 2017 IEEE","authors":["D.

The present paper looks into the similarities and differences across three very similar product development masters courses at three distinct Portuguese higher education institutions - Instituto Superior Tecnico (IST) of the University of Lisbon, Instituto Politecnico do Cavado e Ave (IPCA), and ISCTE business school (IBS) of Instituto Universitario de Lisboa. Product Development and Entrepreneurship is taught at IST mostly for students of mechanical engineering, whereas Advanced Product Development Methodologies is taught at IPCA mostly for industrial design students and New Product Development is taught at ISCTE for business students. All three courses use the same methodology of assessment and the same overall syllabus, with distributed assignments and expected outcomes. However, the nature and emphasis of specific aspects of the students projects are fundamentally different. The reasons for these differences are analyzed by the faculty involved, in the context of the students background and goals and examples are given.

By adapting video games and taking advantage of their technical features such as 3D effects, audio, Internet communications, etc., educators can deliver certain course materials through these games. Meanwhile, whether, or to what extent, these educational adaptations enhance the students learning effectiveness is still the subject of research. In a mechanical engineering educational laboratory, students may face theories or concepts that they have just learned, mechanical devices that they have not previously used as well as collaborative tasks that they have not been assigned before. While traditional educational laboratories may be constrained by hardware, an adaptation of video games may help the students. An immersive gear train laboratory has been developed in which a popular first-person shooting game, Garrys Mod, was adapted. In this paper, an evaluation of this adaptation is presented from both a laboratory performance perspective and a learning effectiveness perspective. 110 undergraduate students who took the junior-level Machine Dynamics and Mechanisms course in the authors university performed video game-based gear train laboratory exercises immediately after attending the lectures and completing the homework related to the chapter on gear design. They were required to form groups for completing the laboratory tasks in the video game environment, where their operations were recorded. Short tests were given to the students before and after the laboratory exercises in order to assess whether their understanding of the course material was enhanced by the laboratory exercises. It was found that the students performance in the laboratory exercises is more likely to be affected by their understanding of the course material than by their familiarity with first-person shooting games. From these tests, it was observed that most students showed an improvement in understanding the course contents after completing the laboratory exercises.","publicationTitle":"Frontiers in Education Conference (FIE), 2016 IEEE","authors":["Yizhe Chang","El-Sayed Aziz","Zhou Zhang","Mingshao Zhang","Sven K.

The access of the internet is easier day by day. My personal experience shows the young generation use smartphones, tablets to keep in contact with friends at home, on public transport, in the school etc. except sleeping. They use different communication forms like community sides, chat rooms and so on. These applications are protected by password authentication system to keep save the data of the users. I was interested for which systems find the mechanical engineering students important in everyday life and what kind of password use for protecting the information. Why is it important? We see almost in every month in the news a service provider was attacked again by hackers and the have put the username and the passwords on the Internet. The success of the attack depends on user error mainly. The companies store sometimes the important data without any protection. On the other hand the users share sensitive information on the community sites (\u0026#x201C;I am going to a party today evening\u0026#x201D;, \u0026#x201C;I am on holiday by the see\u0026#x201D; it means my home is empty tonight if I leave alone). I find the information security is a very important question today when we use lot of systems and we store the important information on devices, in cloud and so on. We have to know how can protect our information so I thought the basics of the information security in subject Informatics I. for the mechanical engineering students in the first semester because they do not have any subject which would include information about this topic. The students filled out an information security awareness questionnaire after the second semester. The multidimensional analysis shows which communication systems are more important to the students. These communications systems are protected by password authentication it means the next step of the analysis how long and how complicated password are used by students after the basic information security course in the first semester. The students had to say, how long password they are using by the most important systems like e-mail, community sites, and so on. The longer password is safer then shorter as we know. The following important question is how complicated is the used password. Is it include just lowercase letters, or include some uppercase letters too? Is it include maybe numbers or special characters like \u0026#x201C;;\u0026#x201D; or \u0026#x201C;,\u0026#x201D;? We need to know some more information about the used passwords. How often change the students these passwords? Are they using same passwords by different systems or one same password? In that case if they use same password it is more important to be the password complicated in other case if it is hacked, the attackers can log on in other systems too what the students use. After the analysis I could see how effective was the basic information security course for the mechanical engineering students. How could I build the information security awareness by them? Was it enough, or should I waste more time on this topic to help them to keep save the sensitive data?","publicationTitle":"Information Technology Based Higher Education and Training (ITHET), 2016 15th International Conference on","authors":["Gabor Kiss","Antonia Szasz"],"link":"http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/7760758/","references":{},"id":"7760758"},{"publicationYear":"2016","doi":"10.1109/SysEng.2016.7753192","stream":"Mechanical Engineering","title":"Target-oriented implementation of systems engineering in medium-sized enterprises: Project example for mbse implementation in mechanical and plant engineering","abstract":"Technical systems of tomorrow will go beyond current traditional mechatronic designs by incorporating inherent intelligence.

There are considerable challenges, particularly because the physical components of such systems introduce safety and reliability requirements qualitatively different from those in general-purpose computing.

The model is useful to identify requirements that Smart Objects have to cover externally as they cannot themselves support them and thus it allows for clear understanding of the external support system (or Middleware) into which the smart object is embedded.","publicationTitle":"Smart Computing (SMARTCOMP), 2014 International Conference on","references":{"6710070":{"upvotes":[],"downvotes":[],"id":"6710070","comments":[]},"5342399":{"upvotes":[],"downvotes":[],"id":"5342399","comments":[]},"1173319":{"upvotes":[],"downvotes":[],"id":"1173319","comments":[]}},"authors":["Marco E.

The reasons to perform assessment are quite varied, ranging from a need to informally understand student learning progress in a course to a need to characterize student expertise in a subject. Finding an appropriate assessment tool is a central challenge in designing an assessment approach. The focus of this paper is on the use of concept maps for both course-level and program-level assessment in engineering education. Concept maps, which are node and arc representations of the relationships among concepts, provide one means to represent student knowledge. This paper presents background on concept maps and describes uses of concept maps at both the course and program level.","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Education","references":{},"authors":["J.

The interface designer is in charge of adjusting the range of optimal speeds according to the scale of the environment and the desired user experience. However, this approach is not valid for complex environments (e.g. multi-scale environments). Optimal speeds might vary for each section of the environment, leading to non-desired side effects such as collisions or simulator sickness. Thereby, we propose a speedadaptation algorithm based on the spatial relationship between the user and the environment and the users perception of motion. The computed information is used to adjust the navigation speed in order to provide an optimal navigation speed and avoid collisions. Two main benefits of our approach is firstly, the ability to adapt the navigation speed in multi-scale environments and secondly, the capacity to provide a smooth navigation experience by decreasing the jerkiness of described trajectories. The evaluation showed that our approach provides comparable performance as existing navigation techniques but it significantly decreases the jerkiness of described trajectories.","publicationTitle":"3D User Interfaces (3DUI), 2014 IEEE Symposium on","authors":["Ferran Argelaguet"],"link":"http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/7027325/","references":{"6790873":{"upvotes":[],"downvotes":[],"id":"6790873","comments":[]},"5307640":{"upvotes":[],"downvotes":[],"id":"5307640","comments":[]},"5759212":{"upvotes":[],"downvotes":[],"id":"5759212","comments":[]},"6479208":{"upvotes":[],"downvotes":[],"id":"6479208","comments":[]}},"id":"7027325"},{"publicationYear":"2000","doi":"10.1162/105474600566952","stream":"Mechanical Engineering","title":"Duration and Exposure to Virtual Environments: Sickness Curves During and Across Sessions","abstract":"Although simulator sickness is known to increase with protracted exposure and to diminish with repeated sessions, limited systematic research has been performed in these areas. This study reviewed the few studies with sufficient information available to determine the effect that exposure duration and repeated exposure have on motion sickness. This evaluation confirmed that longer exposures produce more symptoms and that total sickness subsides over repeated exposures. Additional evaluation was performed to investigate the precise form of this relationship and to determine whether the same form was generalizable across varied simulator environments. The results indicated that exposure duration and repeated exposures are significantly linearly related to sickness outcomes (duration being positively related and repetition negatively related to total sickness). This was true over diverse systems and large subject pools. This result verified the generalizability of the relationships among sickness, exposure duration, and repeated exposures. Additional research is indicated to determine the optimal length of a single exposure and the optimal intersession interval to facilitate adaptation.","publicationTitle":"Presence","authors":["Robert S.

The system was equipped with a means of feedback; it temporarily provided a narrow field of view and a message about navigation speed deceleration, both of which acted as feedback outputs whenever electrophysiological inputs signaled the occurrence of cybersickness. This system is named cybersickness relief virtual environment (CRVE). Forty-seven subjects experienced the VR for 9.5 min twice in CRVE and non-CRVE conditions. The results indicated that the frequency of cybersickness and simulator sickness questionnaire scores were lower in the CRVE condition than in the non-CRVE condition.

We conducted two user studies to evaluate the effectiveness of the change blindness illusion when exploring a virtual environment that was an order of magnitude larger than the physical walking space. Despite the dynamically changing environment, participants were able to draw coherent sketch maps of the environment structure, and pointing task results indicated that they were able to maintain their spatial orientation within the virtual world. Only one out of 77 participants across both both studies definitively noticed that a scene change had occurred, suggesting that change blindness redirection provides a remarkably compelling illusion. Secondary findings revealed that a wide field-of-view increases pointing accuracy and that experienced gamers reported greater sense of presence than those with little or no experience with 3D video games.","publicationTitle":"Virtual Reality Conference (VR), 2011 IEEE","authors":["Evan A.

Here the platform set up and the algorithm adopted in controlling the servos as well as reading from the sensors are described such that any student can reconstruct and start using it to understand his/her subject.","publicationTitle":"Mechatronics (MECATRONICS) , 2012 9th France-Japan \u0026 7th Europe-Asia Congress on and Research and Education in Mechatronics (REM), 2012 13th Int'l Workshop on","references":{"1014740":{"upvotes":[],"downvotes":[],"id":"1014740","comments":[]},"1013335":{"upvotes":[],"downvotes":[],"id":"1013335","comments":[]}},"authors":["Asiya M.

Flipping the classroom switches when assignments (e.g. homework) and knowledge transfer (e.g. lecture) occur.

Flipping a classroom refers to reversing the traditional role of in- and out-of-class activities. This instructional approach is sometimes also called inverting a classroom. In a flipped paradigm, the students are introduced to topics and basic concepts using video lectures or other means during their time outside of the classroom and spend the scheduled class period working on exercises under the supervision of the instructor. Instead of being a sage on the stage the instructor now becomes a guide on the side [1]. The conventional paradigm treats the student as an empty container into which knowledge is poured, while the flipped paradigm treats the student as an active learner who reconstructs knowledge from information. The flipped classroom began to receive increasing attention in the early 2000s (e.g., [2] and [3]) and has become much more accessible to instructors recently with the advent of low-cost screencasting software, e.g., [4], and Web-based course and video management tools.

Examples of online interactive modules in accounting and cost estimating are presented. We follow with a discussion of the resultant transformation of the classroom learning environment along with some samples incorporating open-ended problem solving exercises.

They can be divided in two main classes: polynomial time tests and exact tests. Polynomial time tests can efficiently be used for online guarantee of real-time applications, where tasks are activated at runtime. These tests introduce a negligible overhead, when executed upon a new task arrival, however provide only a sufficient schedulability condition, which may cause a poor processor utilization. On the other hand, exact tests, which are based on response time analysis, provide a necessary and sufficient schedulability condition, but are too complex to be executed on line for large task sets. As a consequence, for large task sets, they are often executed off line. This paper proposes a novel approach for analyzing the schedulability of periodic task sets on a single processor under an arbitrary fixed priority assignment: Using this approach, we derive a new schedulability test which can be tuned through a parameter to balance complexity versus acceptance ratio, so that it can be used on line to better exploit the processor, based on the available computational power. Extensive simulations show that our test, when used in its exact form, is significantly faster than the current response time analysis methods. Moreover the proposed approach, for its elegance and compactness, offers an explanation of some known phenomena of fixed priority scheduling and could be helpful for further work on schedulability analysis.","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Computers","references":{"557785":{"upvotes":[],"downvotes":[],"id":"557785","comments":[]},"238595":{"upvotes":[],"downvotes":[],"id":"238595","comments":[]},"160369":{"upvotes":[],"downvotes":[],"id":"160369","comments":[]},"968681":{"upvotes":[],"downvotes":[],"id":"968681","comments":[]},"1214341":{"upvotes":[],"downvotes":[],"id":"1214341","comments":[]},"528754":{"upvotes":[],"downvotes":[],"id":"528754","comments":[]},"516218":{"upvotes":[],"downvotes":[],"id":"516218","comments":[]},"57058":{"upvotes":[],"downvotes":[],"id":"57058","comments":[]},"811259":{"upvotes":[],"downvotes":[],"id":"811259","comments":[]},"739773":{"upvotes":[],"downvotes":[],"id":"739773","comments":[]},"63567":{"upvotes":[],"downvotes":[],"id":"63567","comments":[]}},"authors":["E.

The annotations are directives for the Giotto compiler, but they do not alter the functionality and timing of a Giotto program. By separating the platform-independent from the platform-dependent concerns, Giotto enables a great deal of flexibility in choosing control platforms as well as a great deal of automation in the validation and synthesis of control software.

A component interface consists of an arrival rate function and a latency for each task sequence, and a capacity function for the shared resource. The interface specifies that the component guarantees certain task latencies depending on assumptions about task arrival rates and allocated resource capacities. Our algebra defines compatibility and refinement relations on interfaces. Interface compatibility can be checked on partial designs, even when some component interfaces are yet unknown. In this case interface composition computes as new assumptions the weakest constraints on the unknown components that are necessary to satisfy the specified guarantees. Interface refinement is defined in a way that ensures that compatible interfaces can be refined and implemented independently.

The emphasis of this article is on switched, highly loaded networks, where unpredictable delays introduce excessive synchronization noise. PC clocks are accurate enough when connected within a network, but a new requirement is for them to be synchronized, which means that they should show the same time at the same instant. The most prominent time-synchronization method is the network time protocol proposed by Mills and Internet engineering task force group. A complete solution of the high-precision time-synchronization problem must reduce the randomness associated with the RTOS. The methods discussed in this article can help determine the frequency and time offset of a local time-of-day clock. The next challenge is to construct a local time-of-day clock and apply the synchronization information to it.","publicationTitle":"IEEE Control Systems","references":{"1159694":{"upvotes":[],"downvotes":[],"id":"1159694","comments":[]},"103043":{"upvotes":[],"downvotes":[],"id":"103043","comments":[]},"996369":{"upvotes":[],"downvotes":[],"id":"996369","comments":[]},"1200240":{"upvotes":[],"downvotes":[],"id":"1200240","comments":[]}},"authors":["S.

The ensuing gain in throughput is moderated by the difficulty of efficiently programming such processors. Techniques for overcoming this difficulty are effective only for modest amounts of pipelining. This paper proposes applying an old but rarely used architectural approach to the design of single-chip signal processors so that the potential benefits of extensive pipelining can be fully realized. The architectural approach is to interleave multiple processes (or programs) through a single deeply pipelined processor in such a way that the disadvantages of deep pipelining disappear. Instead, the user is faced with the need to construct programs that can execute as concurrent processes. The main advantage is that much more pipelining can be used without aggravating the programming. A specific experimental architecture is outlined. The solution offered is a system solution in that architectural performance is considered along with programmability and ease of use. In the companion paper, data flow programming is suggested so that algorithms can be automatically partitioned for concurrent execution. Data flow provides a natural environment in which to build signal processing programs and can be supported efficiently in an architecture of the type described here.","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Acoustics, Speech, and Signal Processing","references":{"1457091":{"upvotes":[],"downvotes":[],"id":"1457091","comments":[]},"1164165":{"upvotes":[],"downvotes":[],"id":"1164165","comments":[]},"1675880":{"upvotes":[],"downvotes":[],"id":"1675880","comments":[]},"1168489":{"upvotes":[],"downvotes":[],"id":"1168489","comments":[]},"1451726":{"upvotes":[],"downvotes":[],"id":"1451726","comments":[]},"1675205":{"upvotes":[],"downvotes":[],"id":"1675205","comments":[]},"5390281":{"upvotes":[],"downvotes":[],"id":"5390281","comments":[]},"1164045":{"upvotes":[],"downvotes":[],"id":"1164045","comments":[]},"1156830":{"upvotes":[],"downvotes":[],"id":"1156830","comments":[]},"1653938":{"upvotes":[],"downvotes":[],"id":"1653938","comments":[]},"1156364":{"upvotes":[],"downvotes":[],"id":"1156364","comments":[]},"1156829":{"upvotes":[],"downvotes":[],"id":"1156829","comments":[]},"6323457":{"upvotes":[],"downvotes":[],"id":"6323457","comments":[]},"5009071":{"upvotes":[],"downvotes":[],"id":"5009071","comments":[]},"1164285":{"upvotes":[],"downvotes":[],"id":"1164285","comments":[]}},"authors":["E.

Using a global, consistent notion of time, DE components communicate via time-stamped events. DE models have primarily been used in performance modeling and simulation, where time stamps are a modeling property bearing no relationship to real time during execution of the model. In this paper, we extend DE models with the capability of relating certain events to physical time. We propose a programming model, called PTIDES (programming temporally integrated distributed embedded systems), which has DE semantics, but with carefully chosen relations between model time and real time. Key to making this model effective is to ensure that constraints that guarantee determinacy in the semantics are preserved at runtime. To accomplish this, we give a distributed execution strategy that obeys DE semantics without the penalty of totally ordered executions based on time stamps. Our technique relies on having a distributed common notion of time, known to some precision. Based on causality analysis of DE models, we define relevant dependency and relevant orders to enable out-of-order execution without compromising determinism and without requiring backtracking","publicationTitle":"Real Time and Embedded Technology and Applications Symposium, 2007.

No matter how virtual walking is controlled, the generation of realistic virtual trajectories is absolutely required for some applications, especially those dedicated to the study of walking behaviors in VR, navigation through virtual places for architecture, rehabilitation and training. Previous studies focused on evaluating the realism of locomotion trajectories have mostly considered the result of the locomotion task (efficiency, accuracy) and its subjective perception (presence, cybersickness). Few focused on the locomotion trajectory itself, but in situation of geometrically constrained task. In this paper, we study the realism of unconstrained trajectories produced during virtual walking by addressing the following question: did the user reach his destination by virtually walking along a trajectory he would have followed in similar real conditions? To this end, we propose a comprehensive evaluation framework consisting on a set of trajectographical criteria and a locomotion model to generate reference trajectories. We consider a simple locomotion task where users walk between two oriented points in space. The travel path is analyzed both geometrically and temporally in comparison to simulated reference trajectories. In addition, we demonstrate the framework over a user study which considered an initial set of common and frequent virtual walking conditions, namely different input devices, output display devices, control laws, and visualization modalities. The study provides insight into the relative contributions of each condition to the overall realism of the resulting virtual trajectories.","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Visualization and Computer Graphics","authors":["Gabriel Cirio","Anne-H\u0026#x00E9;l\u0026#x00E8;ne Olivier","Maud Marchal","Julien Pettr\u0026#x00E9;"],"link":"http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/6479208/","references":{"1512020":{"upvotes":[],"downvotes":[],"id":"1512020","comments":[]},"5204082":{"upvotes":[],"downvotes":[],"id":"5204082","comments":[]},"4115591":{"upvotes":[],"downvotes":[],"id":"4115591","comments":[]},"1492762":{"upvotes":[],"downvotes":[],"id":"1492762","comments":[]},"6790789":{"upvotes":[],"downvotes":[],"id":"6790789","comments":[]},"5759212":{"upvotes":[],"downvotes":[],"id":"5759212","comments":[]},"1199309":{"upvotes":[],"downvotes":[],"id":"1199309","comments":[]},"6788040":{"upvotes":[],"downvotes":[],"id":"6788040","comments":[]},"6165135":{"upvotes":[],"downvotes":[],"id":"6165135","comments":[]},"6797599":{"upvotes":[],"downvotes":[],"id":"6797599","comments":[]},"4756020":{"upvotes":[],"downvotes":[],"id":"4756020","comments":[]}},"id":"6479208"},{"publicationYear":"2009","doi":"10.1109/MCG.2009.115","stream":"Mechanical Engineering","title":"Building on Realism and Magic for Designing 3D Interaction Techniques","abstract":"Imagination-based interaction can complement reality-based interaction in the design of 3D user interfaces.

The theoretical basis for the proposed SV metric and the algorithms for its implementation are presented. Data from two previous experiments on cybersickness were reanalyzed using the metric. Results showed that increasing SV by either increasing the scene complexity or scene velocity significantly increased the rated level of cybersickness.

Subjects exhibited more postural disturbance with increasing FOV. A surprisingly large increase in disturbance was found for the interval between 150/spl deg/ and 180/spl deg/ using the city scene. No statistically significant difference was found for effects of scene content. Two groups (postural stable group and postural unstable group) were identified during experiment. These groups performed differently in the two scene conditions. Future research plans are described.","publicationTitle":"Virtual Reality, 2001. Proceedings.

One group of ten subjects searched for a box in a real office environment. A second group of ten subjects carried out the same task in a virtual environment that simulated the same office. Immediately after their experience, subjects were given two different presence questionnaires in randomized order: the Witmer and Singer Presence (WS), and the questionnaire developed by Slater, Usoh, and Steed (SUS). The paper argues that questionnaires should be able to pass a \u0026#8220;reality test\u0026#8221; whereby under current conditions the presence scores should be higher for real experiences than for virtual ones. Nevertheless, only the SUS had a marginally higher mean score for the real compared to the virtual, and there was no significant difference at all between the WS mean scores. It is concluded that, although such questionnaires may be useful when all subjects experience the same type of environment, their utility is doubtful for the comparison of experiences across environments, such as immersive virtual compared to real, or desktop compared to immersive virtual.","publicationTitle":"Presence","references":{},"authors":["Martin Usoh","Ernest Catena","Sima Arman","Mel Slater"],"link":"http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/6787863/","id":"6787863"},{"publicationYear":"1995","doi":"10.1109/VRAIS.1995.512478","stream":"Mechanical Engineering","title":"The use of sketch maps to measure cognitive maps of virtual environments","abstract":"Cognitive maps are mental models of the relative locations and attributes of phenomena in spatial environments. Understanding how people form cognitive maps of virtual environments is vital to effective virtual world design. Unfortunately, such an understanding is hampered by the difficulty of cognitive map measurement. The present study tests the validity of using sketch maps to examine aspects of virtual world cognitive maps. We predict that subjects who report feeling oriented within the virtual world will produce better sketch maps and so sketch-map accuracy can be used as an external measure of subject orientation and world knowledge. Results show a high positive correlation between subjective ratings of orientation, world knowledge and sketch-map accuracy, supporting our hypothesis that sketch maps provide a valid measure of internal cognitive maps of virtual environments. Results across different worlds also suggest that sketch maps can be used to find an absolute measure for goodness of world design.","publicationTitle":"Virtual Reality Annual International Symposium, 1995.

The traditional solution is to require the user to travel indirectly, using a device that changes his viewpoint in the environment without actually requiring him to move - for example, a joystick. However, other solutions involving variations on direct walking are also possible. In this paper, we present a new metaphor for natural, augmented direct locomotion through moderately large-scale immersive virtual environments (IVEs) presented via head mounted display systems, which we call seven league boots. The key characteristic of this method is that it involves determining a users intended direction of travel and then augmenting only the component of his or her motion that is aligned with that direction. After reviewing previously proposed methods for enabling intuitive locomotion through large IVEs, we begin by describing the technical implementation details of our novel method, discussing the various alternative options that we explored and parameters that we varied in an attempt to attain optimal performance. We then present the results of a pilot observer experiment that we conducted in an attempt to obtain objective, qualitative insight into the relative strengths and weaknesses of our new method, in comparison to the three most commonly used alternative locomotion methods: flying, via use of a wand; normal walking, with a uniform gain applied to the output of the tracker; and normal walking without gain, but with the location and orientation of the larger virtual environment periodically adjusted relative to position of the participant in the real environment. In this study we found, among other things, that for travel down a long, straight virtual hallway, participants overwhelmingly preferred the seven league boots method to the other methods, overall","publicationTitle":"3D User Interfaces, 2007. 3DUI '07.

Techniques proposed to lift this size constraint, enabling real walking in VEs that are larger than the tracked lab space, all require reorientation techniques (ROTs) in the worst-case situation-when a user is close to walking out of the tracked space. We propose a new ROT using visual and audial distractors-objects in the VE that the user focuses on while the VE rotates-and compare our method to current ROTs through three user studies. ROTs using distractors were preferred and ranked more natural by users. Our findings also suggest that improving visual realism and adding sound increased a users feeling of presence.

These phenomena have been observed in both computer generated imagery and real-world scenes. Several studies have demonstrated that change blindness effects occur primarily during visual disruptions such as blinks or saccadic eye movements. However, until now the influence of stereoscopic vision on change blindness has not been studied thoroughly in the context of visual perception research. In this paper we introduce change blindness techniques for stereoscopic projection systems, providing the ability to substantially modify a virtual scene in a manner that is difficult for observers to perceive. We evaluate techniques for passive and active stereoscopic viewing and compare the results to those of monoscopic viewing conditions. For stereoscopic viewing conditions, we found that change blindness phenomena occur with the same magnitude as in monoscopic viewing conditions. Furthermore, we have evaluated the potential of the presented techniques for allowing abrupt, and yet significant, changes of a stereoscopically displayed virtual reality environment.","publicationTitle":"Virtual Reality Conference (VR), 2010 IEEE","references":{"5072212":{"upvotes":[],"downvotes":[],"id":"5072212","comments":[]},"4297685":{"upvotes":[],"downvotes":[],"id":"4297685","comments":[]},"4811208":{"upvotes":[],"downvotes":[],"id":"4811208","comments":[]}},"authors":["Frank Steinicke","Gerd Bruder","Klaus Hinrichs","Pete Willemsen"],"link":"http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/5444790/","id":"5444790"},{"publicationYear":"2010","doi":"10.1109/TVCG.2009.62","stream":"Mechanical Engineering","title":"Estimation of Detection Thresholds for Redirected Walking Techniques","abstract":"In immersive virtual environments (IVEs), users can control their virtual viewpoint by moving their tracked head and walking through the real world. Usually, movements in the real world are mapped one-to-one to virtual camera motions. With redirection techniques, the virtual camera is manipulated by applying gains to user motion so that the virtual world moves differently than the real world. Thus, users can walk through large-scale IVEs while physically remaining in a reasonably small workspace. In psychophysical experiments with a two-alternative forced-choice task, we have quantified how much humans can unknowingly be redirected on physical paths that are different from the visually perceived paths. We tested 12 subjects in three different experiments: (E1) discrimination between virtual and physical rotations, (E2) discrimination between virtual and physical straightforward movements, and (E3) discrimination of path curvature. In experiment E1, subjects performed rotations with different gains, and then had to choose whether the visually perceived rotation was smaller or greater than the physical rotation. In experiment E2, subjects chose whether the physical walk was shorter or longer than the visually perceived scaled travel distance. In experiment E3, subjects estimate the path curvature when walking a curved path in the real world while the visual display shows a straight path in the virtual world. Our results show that users can be turned physically about 49 percent more or 20 percent less than the perceived virtual rotation, distances can be downscaled by 14 percent and upscaled by 26 percent, and users can be redirected on a circular arc with a radius greater than 22 m while they believe that they are walking straight.","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Visualization and Computer Graphics","authors":["Frank Steinicke","Gerd Bruder","Jason Jerald","Harald Frenz","Markus Lappe"],"link":"http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/5072212/","references":{"4476598":{"upvotes":[],"downvotes":[],"id":"4476598","comments":[]},"4161000":{"upvotes":[],"downvotes":[],"id":"4161000","comments":[]},"4142862":{"upvotes":[],"downvotes":[],"id":"4142862","comments":[]},"6790640":{"upvotes":[],"downvotes":[],"id":"6790640","comments":[]},"6797534":{"upvotes":[],"downvotes":[],"id":"6797534","comments":[]},"4160999":{"upvotes":[],"downvotes":[],"id":"4160999","comments":[]},"1667620":{"upvotes":[],"downvotes":[],"id":"1667620","comments":[]},"1492762":{"upvotes":[],"downvotes":[],"id":"1492762","comments":[]},"6790789":{"upvotes":[],"downvotes":[],"id":"6790789","comments":[]},"1492747":{"upvotes":[],"downvotes":[],"id":"1492747","comments":[]},"996544":{"upvotes":[],"downvotes":[],"id":"996544","comments":[]},"6790523":{"upvotes":[],"downvotes":[],"id":"6790523","comments":[]},"996517":{"upvotes":[],"downvotes":[],"id":"996517","comments":[]},"1510541":{"upvotes":[],"downvotes":[],"id":"1510541","comments":[]},"4741303":{"upvotes":[],"downvotes":[],"id":"4741303","comments":[]},"4480761":{"upvotes":[],"downvotes":[],"id":"4480761","comments":[]}},"id":"5072212"},{"publicationYear":"2010","doi":"10.1109/3DUI.2010.5444726","stream":"Mechanical Engineering","title":"Effects of travel technique and gender on a divided attention task in a virtual environment","abstract":"We report a user study which compared four virtual environment travel techniques using a divided attention task. Participants used either real walking, gaze-directed, pointing-directed, or torso-directed travel to follow a target through an environment while simultaneously responding to auditory stimuli. In addition to travel technique, we investigated gender as a between-subjects variable and task difficulty (simple or complex) and task type (single or divided) as within-subjects variables. Real walking allowed superior performance over the pointing-directed technique on measures of navigation task performance and recognition of stimuli presented during navigation. This indicates that participants using real walking may have had more spare cognitive capacity to process and encode stimuli than those using pointing-directed travel. We also found a gender-difficulty interaction where males performed worse and responded slower to the attention task when the spatial task was more difficult, but no differences were observed for females between difficulty levels. While these results may be pertinent for the design of virtual environments, the nature and goal of the virtual environment tasks must be carefully considered to determine whether similar effects on performance can be expected under different conditions.","publicationTitle":"3D User Interfaces (3DUI), 2010 IEEE Symposium on","authors":["Evan A.

The obvious assignment, a group programming project, proved to be a poor choice when implemented in the authors computer graphics class. An examination of the literature in this area shows that a group programming project has many features in common with a group term paper, the assignment which has been uniquely identified as the worst choice for small group work. Fortunately, there are better choices for cooperative learning in computer science. Assignments with the three Ss: same problem, specific choice and simultaneous reporting of group choices, work well. This was implemented in a class by having students work multiple choice quizzes designed to require high level learning skills. Quizzes were first worked by individuals, then by small groups. The small group answers are then compared and discussed in class. This generates the type of interaction between the professor and students which creates positive cooperative learning experiences.

Based on this idea, the curriculum of our department concerning practical robotics education was planned to cultivate the fundamental spirit of students for designing/manufacturing valuable products. In the article, first the basic concepts of practical engineering education are presented. Second, the outline of classes for practical education at the Department of Robotics in Ritsumeikan University are described, including experiments in robotics using 3 degree-of-freedom (DOF) and 6-DOF manipulators and practices of robot making. Then, practical education for a cooperative academia-industry environment is described. Such an education should contribute to the production of valuable products and to the transfer of advanced technologies to industry.","publicationTitle":"IEEE Robotics \u0026 Automation Magazine","references":{},"authors":["K.

To implement the functions required by the course and to facilitate connection to the Internet, the ITESCE is based on a standard browser/server architecture with three layers and employs multithreading, Java applets, and Java database connectivity. Background control subsystems handle the real-time control of experiments, and a network server handles communication with clients and with background control subsystems. A database stores simulation and experimental results. The course covers a variety of control methods, and students can try them out through online simulations and experiments. To enhance realism, a Web camera takes a video of an experiment and streams it to a students PC in real time.","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Industrial Electronics","references":{"855972":{"upvotes":[],"downvotes":[],"id":"855972","comments":[]},"661314":{"upvotes":[],"downvotes":[],"id":"661314","comments":[]},"1282024":{"upvotes":[],"downvotes":[],"id":"1282024","comments":[]},"1234439":{"upvotes":[],"downvotes":[],"id":"1234439","comments":[]},"959095":{"upvotes":[],"downvotes":[],"id":"959095","comments":[]},"4116892":{"upvotes":[],"downvotes":[],"id":"4116892","comments":[]},"1388802":{"upvotes":[],"downvotes":[],"id":"1388802","comments":[]},"1546366":{"upvotes":[],"downvotes":[],"id":"1546366","comments":[]},"1339474":{"upvotes":[],"downvotes":[],"id":"1339474","comments":[]},"4015987":{"upvotes":[],"downvotes":[],"id":"4015987","comments":[]},"1013879":{"upvotes":[],"downvotes":[],"id":"1013879","comments":[]},"1172825":{"upvotes":[],"downvotes":[],"id":"1172825","comments":[]},"1259241":{"upvotes":[],"downvotes":[],"id":"1259241","comments":[]},"1266561":{"upvotes":[],"downvotes":[],"id":"1266561","comments":[]},"915422":{"upvotes":[],"downvotes":[],"id":"915422","comments":[]},"1323144":{"upvotes":[],"downvotes":[],"id":"1323144","comments":[]},"1433183":{"upvotes":[],"downvotes":[],"id":"1433183","comments":[]},"1323142":{"upvotes":[],"downvotes":[],"id":"1323142","comments":[]},"4376277":{"upvotes":[],"downvotes":[],"id":"4376277","comments":[]},"969407":{"upvotes":[],"downvotes":[],"id":"969407","comments":[]},"1708928":{"upvotes":[],"downvotes":[],"id":"1708928","comments":[]},"1628911":{"upvotes":[],"downvotes":[],"id":"1628911","comments":[]},"4376286":{"upvotes":[],"downvotes":[],"id":"4376286","comments":[]},"1022860":{"upvotes":[],"downvotes":[],"id":"1022860","comments":[]},"1628505":{"upvotes":[],"downvotes":[],"id":"1628505","comments":[]},"4015998":{"upvotes":[],"downvotes":[],"id":"4015998","comments":[]},"1191816":{"upvotes":[],"downvotes":[],"id":"1191816","comments":[]}},"authors":["Min Wu","Jin-Hua She","Gui-Xiu Zeng","Yasuhiro Ohyama"],"link":"http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/4475516/","id":"4475516"},{"publicationYear":"2000","doi":"10.1109/5254.895854","stream":"Mechanical Engineering","title":"Integrating robotics research with undergraduate education","abstract":"Swarthmore College takes a two-pronged approach to undergraduate education by integrating educational goals with robotics research.

One of the best approaches to this challenge is to sponsor a technological competition that combines publicity, technology, and student participation. A current leading competition called micromouse, although earning high marks on publicity and technology, has had difficulty attracting large-scale student participation. In this paper a vision-guided autonomous vehicle project developed at California State University, Fullerton (CSUF) is proposed as an alternative. The idea is to fit an ordinary radio-controlled toy car with a charge-coupled device (CCD) camera and a transmitter. Image processing and control of the car are accomplished by a personal computer (PC). The road image captured by the camera is transmitted to a PC via a transmitter-receiver pair at 900 MHz. A frame grabber board digitizes the image, and an image-processing program subsequently analyzes the road condition and generates adequate drive commands that are transmitted back to the vehicle via the built-in radio controller. Student teams write programs to compete in racing or maze solving. In this paper detailed hardware and software designs of the project are presented. The merit of the project with respect to the criteria of publicity, technology, and student participation is also addressed.","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Education","authors":[" Ning Chen"],"link":"http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/650837/","references":{"387215":{"upvotes":[],"downvotes":[],"id":"387215","comments":[]}},"id":"650837"},{"publicationYear":"2003","doi":"10.1109/MRA.2003.1213615","stream":"Mechanical Engineering","title":"Vision-guided mobile robots for design competitions","abstract":"We present the Teaching system integration in engineering curricula at universities via popular and effective robot-design competitions.

Current humanoid robots, however, lack in adaptability, agility, or high-mobility enough to meet the expectations. In order to enhance high-mobility, the humanoid motion should be generated in real-time in accordance with the dynamics, which commonly requires a large amount of computation and has not been implemented so far. We have developed a real-time motion generation method that controls the center of gravity (COG) by indirect manipulation of the zero moment point (ZMP). The real-time response of the method provides humanoid robots with high-mobility. In the paper, the algorithm is presented. It consists of four parts, namely, the referential ZMP planning, the ZMP manipulation, the COG velocity decomposition to joint angles, and local control of joint angles. An advantage of the algorithm lies in its applicability to humanoids with a lot of degrees of freedom. The effectiveness of the proposed method is verified by computer simulations.","publicationTitle":"Robotics and Automation, 2002. Proceedings. ICRA '02.

At the College of Engineering of Oregon State University, we have developed and demonstrated an innovative real-time remote-access control engineering teaching laboratory. Our remote laboratory uses the Internet to provide complete access to the usual laboratory facilities. In addition, remote power control, network reliability, and safety features are integrated into our experimental hardware and software design. Remotely located students are able to develop, compile, debug, and run controllers in real time on the experiments in our laboratory. Students can watch the experiment in real time from a remote workstation, hear the sounds in the laboratory, and interact with other laboratory users. Students can effectively use the laboratory from anywhere on the Internet.","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Education","references":{"258053":{"upvotes":[],"downvotes":[],"id":"258053","comments":[]},"351289":{"upvotes":[],"downvotes":[],"id":"351289","comments":[]},"258062":{"upvotes":[],"downvotes":[],"id":"258062","comments":[]},"220013":{"upvotes":[],"downvotes":[],"id":"220013","comments":[]},"6771096":{"upvotes":[],"downvotes":[],"id":"6771096","comments":[]},"384121":{"upvotes":[],"downvotes":[],"id":"384121","comments":[]}},"authors":["B.

While this is the promise of higher education, a substantial body of research indicates that cognitive growth remains elusive for most universities and for most disciplines, including engineering. In this paper, we discuss a framework for facilitating open ended problem solving through the use of an inverted classroom. A basic premise of the inverted classroom model is that richer open-ended problem solving experiences can be conducted within the classroom environment. Required readings and preparatory work through online interactive materials provide one opportunity for intellectual diversity and allow lectures to be replaced with more engaged pedagogies that require problems to be viewed from multiple perspectives. An example format and preliminary data for a course in cost estimating is presented.","publicationTitle":"Frontiers in Education Conference, 2009.

This paper will discuss the use of the Quiz tool within WebCT for the construction of question banks and their publication to a WebCT server. An example, deriving mathematical expressions, which describes electric circuit behavior and helps customize the homework problems to each individual student, are discussed. In other words, in a class of 200 students, each student is presented with an individual homework assignment with a unique set of problems not repeated to anyone else via WebCT. A help desk staffed by senior undergraduates assists the course students in completing the WebCT-based homework on time. WebCT is an essential ingredient in the delivery of the course. The approach presented in this paper can be adapted to any other course in engineering/science that involves mathematical calculations. So far, the course evaluations suggest that the students are more motivated and excited about electrical and computer engineering as a career.","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Education","references":{"879208":{"upvotes":[],"downvotes":[],"id":"879208","comments":[]},"1186031":{"upvotes":[],"downvotes":[],"id":"1186031","comments":[]},"839265":{"upvotes":[],"downvotes":[],"id":"839265","comments":[]},"839261":{"upvotes":[],"downvotes":[],"id":"839261","comments":[]}},"authors":["L.

Since poor teaching has been shown to contribute to student attrition from engineering, studying the beliefs and practices of faculty who are committed to teaching may provide ideas of how to improve engineering education in general. For this study, interviews were conducted with twenty-six engineering educators at FIE06. Participants were asked to describe what they believed were effective teaching practices. Next, participants were asked to consider a list of teaching practices and rank these according to what they believed were most effective and which they actually utilized.

The actual locations of the underground transmitters in each case were projected to the surface using mine maps and conventional surveying techniques. A crossed loop direction finding receiver was developed to respond to the magnetic field. A null in the horizontal magnetic field was used to identify the surface location directly above the transmitter. Evaluation of this system at five locations in the four mines revealed location errors of 13 meters, 7 meters, 3 meters, 2 meters and 0. 5 meters respectively. Theoretical computations of magnetic field strengths based on transmitter frequency, ground conductivity and transmitter depth are shown along with measured profiles for two of the four mines visited. The effects of uniformly sloping terrain and dipole tilt are also examined theoretically and the results are shown to be consistent with the field measurements made under these conditions. Using known theoretical corrections for hill slope, it is shown that the measured source location can be improved to where it is within three meters of the actual location.","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Geoscience Electronics","references":{"1091650":{"upvotes":[],"downvotes":[],"id":"1091650","comments":[]},"1450254":{"upvotes":[],"downvotes":[],"id":"1450254","comments":[]},"1140008":{"upvotes":[],"downvotes":[],"id":"1140008","comments":[]},"4043465":{"upvotes":[],"downvotes":[],"id":"4043465","comments":[]}},"authors":["R.

It is desirable that the Response-Time Analysis (RTA) can be efficiently performed. This is particularly important in dynamic real-time systems when a fast response is needed to decide whether a new job can be accommodated, or when the RTA is extensively applied, e.g., when used to guide the heuristics in a higher level optimiser. This paper presents a set of methods to improve the efficiency of RTA calculations. The methods are proved correct, in the sense that they give the same results as traditional (non-improved) RTA. We also present an evaluation of the improvements, by applying them to the particularly time-consuming traffic model used in RTA for ATM communication networks. Our evaluation shows that the proposed methods can give an order of magnitude reduction of the execution time of RTA.","publicationTitle":"Real-Time Systems Symposium, 1998. Proceedings.

We define the utilization bound as a function of the information about the task set. By making use of more than just the number of tasks, we obtain various improvements over the Liu and Layland bound. In particular, we give a more intuitive derivation of the bound as a function of the number of harmonic chains in the task periods which allows us to derive a simpler algorithm to calculate such bounds. We derive algorithms that yield better bounds as a function of the period parameters of the task set.

We further show that active messages are sufficient to implement the dynamically scheduled languages for which message driven machines were designed. With this mechanism, latency tolerance becomes a programming/compiling concern. Hardware support for active messages is desirable and we outline a range of enhancements to mainstream processors.","publicationTitle":"Computer Architecture, 1992.

Experiments show the superiority of these algorithms compared to previous approaches like critical path heuristics and ILP based optimal scheduling. An extension of our approach allows the scheduling of conditional process graphs capturing both data and control flow.

This method can be used to analyze the schedulability of any task set on a uniprocessor whose priority structure can be modeled as serially executed subtasks, which can lead to a very complex priority structure.

A possible way of composing applications is through the resource reservation approach. Each application is handled by a dedicated server that is assigned a fraction of the processor. Using this approach, the system can be seen as a two-level hierarchical scheduler. A considerable amount of work has been recently addressed to the analysis of this kind of hierarchical systems. However, a question is still unanswered: given a set of real-time tasks to be handled by a server, how to assign the server parameters so that the task set is feasible? In this paper, we answer to the previous question for the case of fixed priority local scheduler by presenting a methodology for computing the class of server parameters that make the task set feasible.","publicationTitle":"Real-Time Systems, 2003.

Tasks within the same task group are scheduled by an application-task-level scheduler that is specialized to the real-time requirements of the tasks in the group. An ideal goal for resource partitioning in real-time systems is to achieve a complete separation of concerns so that: (1) each task group may be executed as if it had access to its own dedicated resource, and (2) there is minimal interaction between the resource-level scheduler and the application-task-level scheduler. In [15], we introduced the notion of a real-time virtual resource which operates at a fraction of the rate of the shared physical resource and whose rate of operation varies with time but is bounded. In this paper we discuss an approach to bound the variation of the rate of operation of a real-time virtual resource by characterizing the rate variation from both temporal and supply dimensions and by expanding on the concept of regularity that was first introduced in [19]. For the case of regular resource partitioning, we show that the utilization bounds of both fixed-priority scheduling and dynamic-priority scheduling remain unchanged from those for dedicated resources. We determine the utilization bounds for the more general case of irregular partitioning. In particular, both types of partitions can be efficiently constructed by exploiting compositionality, properties vis-a-vis the regularity measure.","publicationTitle":"Real-Time Systems Symposium, 2001.

With these abstraction methods, for a hierarchy of schedulers, we introduce a composition method that derives the timing requirements of a parent scheduler from the timing requirements of its child schedulers in a compositional manner such that the timing requirement of the parent scheduler is satisfied, if and only if the timing requirements of its child schedulers are satisfied.","publicationTitle":"Real-Time Systems Symposium, 2003.

In our earlier work, we addressed the problems using the Liu and Layland periodic model. In this paper, we address the problems using another well-known model, a bounded-delay resource partition model, as a solution model to the problems. To extend our framework to this model, we develop an exact feasibility condition for a set of bounded-delay tasks over a bounded-delay resource partition. In addition, we present simulation results to evaluate the overheads that the component demand abstraction results incur in terms of utilization increase. We also present utilization bound results on a bounded-delay resource model.","publicationTitle":"Real-Time Systems Symposium, 2004.

Compositions of processes are processes with behaviors in the intersection of the behaviors of the component processes. The interaction between processes is through signals, which are collections of events. Each event is a value-tag pair, where the tags can come from a partially ordered or totally ordered set. Timed models are where the set of tags is totally ordered. Synchronous events share the same tag, and synchronous signals contain events with the same set of tags. Synchronous processes have only synchronous signals as behaviors. Strict causality (in timed tag systems) and continuity (in untimed tag systems) ensure determinacy under certain technical conditions.

If a special-purpose VLSI chip is designed for a particular signal processing task, such as FIR filtering, for example, the maximum clock rate, and hence throughput, is determined by the depth of the combinational logic between registers and the time required for the distribution and operation of the clock. If the combinational logic is sufficiently deep (in bit-parallel circuits, for example), the throughput can be increased by inserting intermediate stages of clocked latches. This is at the expense of increased area and delay to operate and clock the intermediate registers. Roughly speaking, the strategy amounts to using more of the chip area to store information useful for pipelining. This paper investigates the optimal tradeoff between the degree of intermediate latching and cost, using the measure AP, where A is the chip area and P is the period (the reciprocal of throughput). We derive expressions for the time and area before and after intermediate latching, using the Mead-Conway model, both for the cases of on-chip and off-chip clock drivers. The results show that significant reductions in AP product (reciprocal of throughput per unit area) can be achieved by intermediate latching in many typical signal processing applications, for a wide range of circuit parameters. The array multiplier is used as an example.","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Acoustics, Speech, and Signal Processing","authors":["P. Cappello","A. LaPaugh","K.

The crux of our approach lies in the heuristic function used to select the task to be scheduled next. The heuristic function is composed of three weighted factors. These factors explicitly consider information about real-time constraints of tasks and their utilization of resources. Simulation studies show that the weights for the various factors in the heuristic function have to be fine-tuned in order to obtain a degree of success in the range of 75-88 percent of that obtained via exhaustive search. However, modifying the approach to use limited backtracking improves the degree of success substantially to as high as 99.5 percent. This improvement is observed even when the initial set of weights are not tailored for a particular set of tasks. Simulation studies also show that in most cases the schedule determined by the heuristic algorithm is optimal or close to optimal.","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Software Engineering","references":{"6312211":{"upvotes":[],"downvotes":[],"id":"6312211","comments":[]},"1675884":{"upvotes":[],"downvotes":[],"id":"1675884","comments":[]},"1702697":{"upvotes":[],"downvotes":[],"id":"1702697","comments":[]},"1658932":{"upvotes":[],"downvotes":[],"id":"1658932","comments":[]},"1695183":{"upvotes":[],"downvotes":[],"id":"1695183","comments":[]},"1654050":{"upvotes":[],"downvotes":[],"id":"1654050","comments":[]},"1395003":{"upvotes":[],"downvotes":[],"id":"1395003","comments":[]},"1659049":{"upvotes":[],"downvotes":[],"id":"1659049","comments":[]}},"authors":[" Wei Zhao","K.

We have defined new performance measures for real-time controller computers based on this coupling. We present a systematic study of a typical critical controlled process in the context of new performance measures that express the performance of both controlled processes and controller computers (taken as a unit) on the basis of a single variable: controller response time. Controller response time is a function of current system state, system failure rate, electrical and/or magnetic interference, etc., and is therefore a random variable. Control overhead is expressed as monotonically nondecreasing function of the response time and the system suffers catastrophic failure, or dynamic failure, if the response time for a control task exceeds the corresponding system hard deadline, if any. The controlled-process chosen for study is an aircraft in the final stages of descent, just prior to landing. Control constraints are particularly severe during this period, and great care must be taken in the design of controllers that handle this process. First, the performance measures for the controller are presented. Second, control algorithms for solving the landing problem are discussed, and finally the impact of our performance measures on the problem is analyzed, showing that the performance measures and the associated estimation method have potential use for designing and/or evaluating real-time controllers and controlled process.

In contrast to a component description that describes what a component does, a component interface describes how a component can be used, and a well designed component interface provides enough information to decide whether two or more components can work together properly in a system. Real-Time Interfaces expand the idea of interfacebased design to the area of real-time system design, where the term of working together properly refers to questions like: Does the composed system satisfy all requested real-time properties such as delay and throughput constraints? In this work, we extend the theory of Real-Time Interfaces and prove its applicability for the design of systems with hierarchical scheduling. We introduce a component system for interface-based design of systems with mixed FP, RM and EDF scheduling. We then further extend the ability for hierarchic scheduling by introducing server components. The introduced component system with Real-Time Interfaces not only allows interface-based design of complex real-time systems with hierarchical scheduling, but also inherently enables detailed schedulability analysis of such systems.","publicationTitle":"Real-Time and Embedded Technology and Applications Symposium, 2006.

Among all the possible trajectories reaching a given goal what are the fundamental reasons to chose one trajectory instead of another? The underlying idea to attack this question has been to relate this problem to an optimal control problem: the trajectory is chosen according to some optimization principle. This is our basic starting assumption. The subject being viewed as a controlled system, the question becomes what criteria is optimized? Is it the time to perform the trajectory? the length of the path? the minimum jerk along the path?... In this study we show that the human locomotor trajectories are well approximated by the geodesics of a differential system minimizing the L\u003csub\u003e2\u003c/sub\u003e norm of the control. Such geodesics are made of arcs of clothoids. The clothoid or Cornu spiral is a curve, whose curvature grows with the distance from the origin.

However, we have observed that geometrically correct optic flow appears to be too slow during simulated locomotion on a treadmill. Experiment 1 documents the effect in a head-mounted display. Experiment 2 shows that the effect is eliminated when the gaze is directed downward or to the side, or when the walking speed is slow. Experiment 3 shows that the effect is unchanged by stride length. Experiment 4 verifies that the effect is not attributable to image jitter. The change in perceived speed from straight ahead to side or down gaze coincides with a shift from expanding optic flow to lamellar flow. Therefore, we hypothesize that lamellar flow is necessary for accurate speed perception, and that a limited field of view eliminates this cue during straight-ahead gaze.","publicationTitle":"Presence","references":{},"authors":["Tom Banton","Jeanine Stefanucci","Frank Durgin","Adam Fass","Dennis Proffitt"],"link":"http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/6790789/","id":"6790789"},{"publicationYear":"2003","doi":"10.1109/CASA.2003.1199309","stream":"Mechanical Engineering","title":"Realistic human walking paths","abstract":"Pedestrian navigation is a complex function of human dynamics, a desired destination, and the presence of obstacles.

However, walking is inherently limited by the restricted physical space, both due to the screens (limited translation) and the missing back screen (limited rotation). In this paper, we propose three novel locomotion techniques that have three concurrent goals: keep the user safe from reaching the translational and rotational boundaries; increase the amount of real walking and finally, provide a more enjoyable and ecological interaction paradigm compared to traditional controller-based approaches. We notably introduce the Virtual Companion, which uses a small bird to guide the user through VEs larger than the physical space. We evaluate the three new techniques through a user study with travel-to-target and path following tasks. The study provides insight into the relative strengths of each new technique for the three aforementioned goals. Specifically, if speed and accuracy are paramount, traditional controller interfaces augmented with our novel warning techniques may be more appropriate; if physical walking is more important, two of our paradigms (extended Magic Barrier Tape and Constrained Wand) should be preferred; last, fun and ecological criteria would favor the Virtual Companion.","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Visualization and Computer Graphics","references":{"4142862":{"upvotes":[],"downvotes":[],"id":"4142862","comments":[]},"6797534":{"upvotes":[],"downvotes":[],"id":"6797534","comments":[]},"4811213":{"upvotes":[],"downvotes":[],"id":"4811213","comments":[]},"6787999":{"upvotes":[],"downvotes":[],"id":"6787999","comments":[]},"4811208":{"upvotes":[],"downvotes":[],"id":"4811208","comments":[]},"6797345":{"upvotes":[],"downvotes":[],"id":"6797345","comments":[]},"6790523":{"upvotes":[],"downvotes":[],"id":"6790523","comments":[]},"1512020":{"upvotes":[],"downvotes":[],"id":"1512020","comments":[]},"4480761":{"upvotes":[],"downvotes":[],"id":"4480761","comments":[]}},"authors":["Gabriel Cirio","Peter Vangorp","Emmanuelle Chapoulie","Maud Marchal","Anatole Lecuyer","George Drettakis"],"link":"http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/6165135/","id":"6165135"},{"publicationYear":"1999","doi":"10.1162/105474699566503","stream":"Mechanical Engineering","title":"Path Reproduction Tests Using a Torus Treadmill","abstract":"This paper describes experiments regarding navigation performance using a new locomotion interface for walking through virtual space. Although traveling on foot is the most intuitive style of locomotion, proprioceptive feedback from walking is not provided in most applications of virtual environments. We developed an infinite surface driven by actuators for enabling a sense of walking. Torus-shaped surfaces are selected to realize the locomotion interface. The device employs twelve sets of treadmills, connected side by side and driven in perpendicular directions. The virtual infinite surface is generated by the motion of the treadmills. A walker can go in any direction while his/her position is fixed in the real world. The device is called a \u003citalic\u003eTorus Treadmill.\u003c/italic\u003e Navigation performance was measured by path-reproduction tests. Subjects were immersed in a virtual grass-covered plain on which a cone-shaped target object was placed. The subjects first traveled to the target object. After they reached it, the target object disappeared and the rehomed subjects were asked to return to the place where the target object was placed. We also set two target objects, and the subject traveled along a bent path. We compared two locomotion modes: walking on the Torus Treadmill and moving purely by joystick operation.

We explore the effect of being able to see ones own body in such systems on an objective measure of the accuracy of one form of space perception. Using an action-based response measure, we found that participants who explored near space while seeing a fully-articulated and tracked visual representation of themselves subsequently made more accurate judgments of absolute egocentric distance to locations ranging from 4 m to 6 m away from where they were standing than did participants who saw no avatar. A nonanimated avatar also improved distance judgments, but by a lesser amount. Participants who viewed either animated or static avatars positioned 3 m in front of their own position made subsequent distance judgments with similar accuracy to the participants who viewed the equivalent animated or static avatar positioned at their own location.

We identified metrics and collected data that captured task performance and the underlying kinematics of the task.

However, the strong utility of pure 3D interfaces for medical, architectural, product design, and scientific visualization means that interface design for pure 3D remains an important challenge. An intriguing possibility is that enhanced 3D interfaces might offer simpler navigation, more compelling functionality, safer movements, and less occlusion, than 3D reality, especially for information exploration and visualization tasks. Such features can enable superhuman capabilities such as faster-than-light teleportation, flying through objects, and X-ray vision. Enhanced 3D interfaces might have supernatural tools such as magic wands for instantly shrinking, enlarging, duplicating, or sending objects and enchanted environments that provide error prevention, history keeping, and programming-by-demonstration. Playful game designers and creative application developers have already pushed the technology further than those who seek merely to mimic reality. Advanced designs are marked by their support of rapid situation awareness through effective overviews, reduced numbers of actions to accomplish tasks; and prompt, meaningful feedback for user actions.

Our approach emphasizes the close relationship between the shape of the locomotor paths in goal-directed movements and the simplified kinematic model of a wheeled mobile robot. This kind of system has been extensively studied in robotics community. From a kinematic perspective, the characteristic of this wheeled robot is the nonholonomic constraint of the wheels on the floor, which forces the vehicle to move tangentially to its main axis. Humans do not walk sideways. This obvious observation indicates that some constraints (mechanical, anatomical...) act on human bodies restricting the way humans generate locomotor trajectories. To model this, we propose a differential system that respects nonholonomic constraints. We validate this model by comparing simulated trajectories with actual (recorded) trajectories produced during goal-oriented locomotion in humans. Subjects had to start from a pre-defined position and direction to cross over a distant porch (position and orientation of the porch were the two manipulated factors). Such comparative analysis is undertaken by making use of numerical methods to compute the control inputs from actual trajectories. Three body frames have been considered: head, pelvis and trunk. It appears that the trunk can be considered as a kind of a steering wheel that steers the human body with a delay of around 0.2 second. This model has been validated on a database of 1,560 trajectories recorded from seven subjects. It opens a promising route to better understand the human locomotion via differential geometry tools successfully experienced in mobile robotics","publicationTitle":"Biomedical Robotics and Biomechatronics, 2006.

A simple model of camera motion is first proposed. This model uses: (1) oscillating motions for the position of the camera, and (2) a compensation motion which changes the orientation of the camera and simulate oculomotor compensation to keep a constant focal point when walking. Then we describe two experiments which were conducted to study the characteristics of our model and the preference of the users in terms of sensation of walking. The first experiment compared the use of oscillating camera motions along the three directions of space. The oscillating motions were all preferred to the control condition (i.e. a linear motion, as if the user was driving a car). Furthermore, the participants preferred oscillating motions along the vertical axis, compared with the two other directions of space. The second experiment was focused on the use of a compensation motion. It showed that on average participants preferred a compensated motion during the walk, as compared with a motion with a constant orientation of the camera. These results are consistent with the way our body and eyes move naturally when walking in real life. Taken together, our results suggest that camera motions can considerably improve the sensation of walking in virtual environments. Camera motions could be further introduced in numerous applications of virtual reality in which the simulation of walking is important, such as: architectural visits, training simulations, or videogames.","publicationTitle":"Virtual Reality Conference, 2006","references":{"781194":{"upvotes":[],"downvotes":[],"id":"781194","comments":[]},"583043":{"upvotes":[],"downvotes":[],"id":"583043","comments":[]},"1041736":{"upvotes":[],"downvotes":[],"id":"1041736","comments":[]},"756956":{"upvotes":[],"downvotes":[],"id":"756956","comments":[]},"964526":{"upvotes":[],"downvotes":[],"id":"964526","comments":[]},"1287198":{"upvotes":[],"downvotes":[],"id":"1287198","comments":[]},"1191147":{"upvotes":[],"downvotes":[],"id":"1191147","comments":[]},"6788943":{"upvotes":[],"downvotes":[],"id":"6788943","comments":[]},"1510541":{"upvotes":[],"downvotes":[],"id":"1510541","comments":[]},"840369":{"upvotes":[],"downvotes":[],"id":"840369","comments":[]}},"authors":["A.

While walking freely around in the user environment, the user sees the remote environment through the \u0026#8220;eyes\u0026#8221; of a remote mobile teleoperator. For that purpose, the users motion is tracked and transferred to the teleoperator. Without additional processing of the motion data, the size of the remote environment to be explored is limited to the size of the user environment. This paper proposes an extension of telepresent walking to arbitrarily large remote or virtual spaces based on compressing wide-area motion into the available user space. Motion compression is a novel approach and does not make use of scaling or walking-in-place metaphors. Rather, motion compression introduces some deviation of curvature between user motion and teleoperator motion. An optimization approach is used to find the user path of minimum curvature deviation with respect to a given predicted teleoperator path that fits inside the boundaries of the user environment. Turning angles and travel distan ces are mapped with a 1:1 ratio to provide the desired impression of realistic selflocomotion in the teleoperators environment. The effects of the curvature deviation on inconsistent perception of locomotion are studied in two experiments.","publicationTitle":"Presence","references":{},"authors":["Norbert Nitzsche","Uwe D.

In recent experiments (Interrante et al., 2006), we have found that participants appear less prone to significantly underestimate egocentric distances in HMD-based IVEs, relative to in the real world, in the special case that they unambiguously know, through first-hand observation, that the presented virtual environment is a high fidelity 3D model of their concurrently occupied real environment. We had hypothesized that this increased veridicality might be due to participants having a stronger sensation of presence in the IVE under these conditions of co-location, which state of mind leads them to act on their visual input in the IVE similarly as they would in the real world (the presence hypothesis). However, alternative hypotheses are also possible. Primary among these is the visual calibration hypothesis: participants could be relying on metric information gleaned from their exposure to the real environment to calibrate their judgments of sizes and distances in the matched virtual environment. It is important to disambiguate between the presence and visual calibration hypotheses because they suggest different directions for efforts to facilitate veridical distance perception in general (non-co-located) IVEs. In this paper, we present the results of an experiment that seeks novel insight into this question. Using a mixed within- and between-subjects design, we compare participants relative ability to accurately estimate egocentric distances in three different virtual environment models: one that is an identical match to the occupied real environment; one in which each of the walls in our virtual room model has been surreptitiously moved ~10% inward towards the center of the room; and one in which each of the walls has been surreptitiously moved ~10% outwards from the center of the room. If the visual calibration hypothesis holds, then we should expect to see a degradation in the accuracy of peoples distance judgments in the surreptitiously modified models, manifested as an underestimation of distances when the IVE is actually larger than the real room and as an overestimation of distances when the IVE is smaller. However, what we found is that distances were significantly underestimated in the virtual environment relative to in the real world in each of the surreptitiously modified room environments, while remaining reasonably accurate (consistent with our previous findings) in the case of the faithfully size-matched room environment.

We define an effectiveness measure for a cells-and-portals partitioning, and introduce a two-pass algorithm that computes a cells-and-portals partition. The algorithm uses a simple heuristic that creates short portals as a mean for generating an effective partition. The input to the algorithm is a set of half edges in 2D that can be extracted from a complex polygonal model. The first pass of the algorithm creates an initial partition, which is then refined by the second pass. We show that our method creates a partition that is more effective than the common BSP partition, even when the latter is further refined with the application of our second pass. Our cells-and-portals algorithm is designed to deal with arbitrarily oriented walls. The algorithm also supports outdoor scenes, where the vertical walls of the buildings served as occluders and portals are extended above the buildings. We show that the extended portals allow an output-sensitive rendering of large urban scenes. Finally, since our two-pass method is fully automatic and local, it supports incremental changes of the model by locally recomputing and updating the partition. We call our method Breaking the Walls (BW) since it breaks out of indoor scenes to outdoor scenes, and allows walls to be broken interactively, with an instant updating of the partition.","publicationTitle":"Computer Graphics and Applications, 2003.

However, the size of the virtual world often exceeds the size of the tracked space so that a straightforward implementation of omni-directional and unlimited walking is not possible. Redirected walking is one concept to solve this problem of walking in IVEs by inconspicuously guiding the user on a physical path that may differ from the path the user visually perceives. When the user approaches a virtual object she can be redirected to a real proxy object that is registered to the virtual counterpart and provides passive haptic feedback. In such passive haptic environments, any number of virtual objects can be mapped to proxy objects having similar haptic properties, e.g., size, shape and texture. The user can sense a virtual object by touching its real world counterpart. Redirecting a user to a registered proxy object makes it necessary to predict the users intended position in the IVE. Based on this target position we determine a path through the physical space such that the user is guided to the registered proxy object. We present a taxonomy of possible redirection techniques that enable user guidance such that inconsistencies between visual and proprioceptive stimuli are imperceptible.We describe how a users target in the virtual world can be predicted reliably and how a corresponding real-world path to the registered proxy object can be derived.","publicationTitle":"Cyberworlds, 2008 International Conference on","references":{"4476598":{"upvotes":[],"downvotes":[],"id":"4476598","comments":[]},"4161000":{"upvotes":[],"downvotes":[],"id":"4161000","comments":[]},"4142862":{"upvotes":[],"downvotes":[],"id":"4142862","comments":[]},"583043":{"upvotes":[],"downvotes":[],"id":"583043","comments":[]},"6797534":{"upvotes":[],"downvotes":[],"id":"6797534","comments":[]},"4160999":{"upvotes":[],"downvotes":[],"id":"4160999","comments":[]},"1667620":{"upvotes":[],"downvotes":[],"id":"1667620","comments":[]},"4145210":{"upvotes":[],"downvotes":[],"id":"4145210","comments":[]},"1492747":{"upvotes":[],"downvotes":[],"id":"1492747","comments":[]},"996544":{"upvotes":[],"downvotes":[],"id":"996544","comments":[]},"6790523":{"upvotes":[],"downvotes":[],"id":"6790523","comments":[]},"380761":{"upvotes":[],"downvotes":[],"id":"380761","comments":[]},"799737":{"upvotes":[],"downvotes":[],"id":"799737","comments":[]},"1510541":{"upvotes":[],"downvotes":[],"id":"1510541","comments":[]},"4480761":{"upvotes":[],"downvotes":[],"id":"4480761","comments":[]}},"authors":["Frank Steinicke","Gerd Bruder","Luv Kohli","Jason Jerald","Klaus Hinrichs"],"link":"http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/4741303/","id":"4741303"},{"publicationYear":"2009","doi":"10.1109/VR.2009.4811024","stream":"Mechanical Engineering","title":"Does a Gradual Transition to the Virtual World increase Presence?","abstract":"In order to increase a users sense of presence in an artificial environment some researchers propose a gradual transition from reality to the virtual world instead of immersing users into the virtual world directly.

Although this procedure is already applied in VR demonstrations, until now it has not been verified whether the usage of such a transitional environment - as transition between real and virtual environment - increases someones sense of presence. We have observed subjective, physiological and behavioral reactions of subjects during a fully-immersive flight phobia experiment under two different conditions: the virtual flight environment was displayed immediately, or subjects visited a transitional environment before entering the virtual flight environment. We have quantified to what extent a gradual transition to the VE via a transitional environment increases the level of presence. We have found that subjective responses show significantly higher scores for the users sense of presence, and that subjects behavioral reactions change when a transitional environment is shown first. Considering physiological reactions, no significant difference could be found.","publicationTitle":"Virtual Reality Conference, 2009. VR 2009.

The most intuitive way to move about the real world is to travel on foot. People often feel a better sense of distance or direction while walking than while riding in a vehicle. This article discusses the development of a locomotion device that provides a sense of walking. In terms of natural interaction, the physical exertion of walking proves essential to locomotion. The research of my colleagues and I aims to give users a sense of walking while their position remains localized in the physical world. Weve developed several prototypes of interface devices for walking. From the results of our research, we concluded that an infinite surface would offer an ideal means for giving people a sense of walking. Our device, called the Torus Treadmill, uses a torus-shaped surface to realize the locomotion interface. The surface employs 12 sets of treadmills connected side-by-side and driven in a perpendicular direction. These treadmills generate an infinite surface. We measured the motion of the users feet with magnetic sensors. The floor moves in the opposite direction of the walker, canceling the motion of each step. The walkers position remains localized in the real world by this computer-controlled motion of the floor. The walker can freely change direction. An image of the virtual space appears in a head-mounted display corresponding to the walkers virtual position.","publicationTitle":"IEEE Computer Graphics and Applications","authors":["H.

The goal is to allow the user to move through virtual environments in as similar a manner as possible to walking through the real world. We approach this problem by examining the interrelationships between motion control and the other actions people use to act, sense, and react to their environment. If the interactions between control actions and sensory feedback can be made comparable to those of actions in the real world, then there is hope for constructing an effective new technique. Candidate solutions are reviewed once the analysis is developed. This analysis leads to a promising new design for a sensor-based virtual locomotion called \u003citalic\u003eGaiter.\u003c/italic\u003e The new control allows users to direct their movement through virtual environments by stepping in place. The movement of a persons legs is sensed, and in-place walking is treated as a gesture indicating the user intends to take a virtual step. More specifically, the movement of the users legs determines the direction, extent, and timing of their movement through virtual environments. Tying virtual locomotion to leg motion allows a person to step in any direction and control the stride length and cadence of his virtual steps. The user can walk straight, turn in place, and turn while advancing. Motion is expressed in a body-centric coordinate system similar to that of actual stepping. The system can discriminate between gestural and actual steps, so both types of steps can be intermixed.","publicationTitle":"Presence","authors":["James N. Templeman","Patricia S.

In order to ensure a high degree of telepresence realism, it is critical that the local user has the ability to control the remote agents movement through the users own locomotion. The required motion of the remote agent is determined according to its environment and the specific task it is to perform. The local users environment is usually different from that of the remote agent in terms of the shapes and dimensions. A motion mapping is needed from the remote agent to the local user to ensure the similarity of the paths in the two environments. In particular, the terminal position of the local user after a segment of movement is also an important portion in such a motion mapping. This paper progressively addresses these issues from the optimization point of view. Two strategies are suggested for solving the motion mapping problem for the single user case. The resulting solutions are then extended to the multiuser case where several local users share a local environment to control different remote agents. Extensive simulations and comparisons show the feasibility and effectiveness of the proposed approaches.","publicationTitle":"Presence","authors":["Jianbo Su"],"link":"http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/6797534/","references":{},"id":"6797534"},{"publicationYear":"2000","doi":"10.1162/105474600566574","stream":"Mechanical Engineering","title":"Inertial-Force Feedback for the Treadport Locomotion Interface","abstract":"The inertial force due to the acceleration of a locomotion interface is identified as a difference between virtual and real-world locomotion.

Their task was to indicate the direction to these target objects from a terminal location in the maze (from which the objects could no longer be seen). Subjects controlled their motion through the mazes using three locomotion modes. In the Walk mode, subjects walked normally in the experimental room. For each subject, body position and heading were tracked, and the tracking information was used to continuously update the visual imagery presented to the subjects on a head-mounted display. This process created the impression of immersion in the experimental maze. In the Visual Turn mode subjects moved through the environment using a joystick to control their turning. The only sensory information subjects received about rotation and translation was that provided by the computer-generated imagery. The Real Turn mode was midway between the other two modes, in that subjects physically turned in place to steer while translating in the virtual maze; thus translation through the maze was signaled only by the computer-generated imagery, whereas rotations were signaled by the imagery as well as by proprioceptive and vestibular information. The dependent measure in the experiment was the absolute error of the subjects directional estimate to each target from the terminal location. Performance in the Walk mode was significantly better than in the Visual Turn mode but other trends were not significant. A secondary finding was that the degree of motion sickness depended upon locomotion mode, with the lowest incidence occurring in the Walk mode. Both findings suggest the advisability of having subjects explore virtual environments using real rotations and translations in tasks involving spatial orientation.","publicationTitle":"Presence","references":{},"authors":["Sarah S.

This technique tested for contrast effects due to demand characteristics in which administration of the questionnaire itself suggested to the participant that the virtual environment may produce motion sickness. Results indicate that reports of motion sickness after immersion in a virtual environment are much greater when both pre and postquestionnaires are given than when only a posttest questionnaire is used. The implications for assessments of motion sickness in virtual environments are discussed.","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Visualization and Computer Graphics","references":{"756954":{"upvotes":[],"downvotes":[],"id":"756954","comments":[]},"250914":{"upvotes":[],"downvotes":[],"id":"250914","comments":[]}},"authors":["Sean D.

This paper presents a new omni-directional locomotion interface based on step-in-place movement and a smart-turntable system to impart users with the ability to move freely in any direction within VEs without loosing sight of the displayed image despite its projection on a limited large screen that does not provide surrounding or 360/spl deg/ visual feedback. The novelty of the interface is that: (a) it uses a smart-turntable with embedded sensors as a walking platform that compensate users rotations rather than their displacements; (b) no cable attachments are made to the user body; and (c) the user can make many full body rotations without loosing sight of the environment, virtually providing a surrounding display despite the use of the limited size screen.","publicationTitle":"Virtual Reality, 2002.

Some virtual environment designers prevent visual interpenetration, making the assumption that prevention improves user experience. However, preventing visual avatar interpenetration causes discrepancy between visual and proprioceptive cues. We investigated users detection thresholds for visual interpenetration (the depth at which they see that two objects have interpenetrated) and sensory discrepancy (the displacement at which they notice mismatched visual and proprioceptive cues). We found that users are much less sensitive to visual-proprioceptive conflict than they are to visual interpenetration. We present our plan for using this result to create a better technique for dealing with virtual object penetration.","publicationTitle":"Virtual Reality, 2005. Proceedings. VR 2005.

This paper describes a new WIP interface that improves both latency and the continuity of synthesized locomotion in the virtual environment. By basing the virtual avatar motion on the speed of the users heel motion while walking in place, we create a direct mapping from foot-motion to locomotion that is responsive, intuitive, and easy to implement. In this paper, we describe the technique, analyze its starting and stopping latency, and provide experimental results on the suppression of false steps and general usability of the system.","publicationTitle":"3D User Interfaces, 2008. 3DUI 2008.

How significant are these distortions for spatial perception in virtual reality? In this study, we used a helmet-mounted display and a mechanical head tracker to investigate the tolerance to errors between head motions and the resulting visual display. The relationship between the head movement and the associated updating of the visual display was adjusted by subjects until the image was judged as stable relative to the world. Both rotational and translational movements were tested, and the relationship between the movements and the direction of gravity was varied systematically. Typically, for the display to be judged as stable, subjects needed the visual world to be moved in the opposite direction to the head movement by an amount greater than the head movement itself, during both rotational and translational head movements, although a large range of movement was tolerated and judged as appearing stable. These results suggest that it not necessary to model the visual geometry accurately and suggest circumstances when tracker drift can be corrected by jumps in the display which will pass unnoticed by the user.","publicationTitle":"Virtual Reality, 2002.

Point-to-origin Studies Revealed Qualitative Errors in Visual Path Integration","abstract":"Even in state-of-the-art virtual reality (VR) setups, participants often feel lost when navigating through virtual environments. In psychological experiments, such disorientation is often compensated for by extensive training. The current study investigated participants sense of direction by means of a rapid point-to-origin task without any training or performance feedback. This allowed us to study participants intuitive spatial orientation in VR while minimizing the influence of higher cognitive abilities and compensatory strategies. After visually displayed passive excursions along one-or two-segment trajectories, participants were asked to point back to the origin of locomotion as accurately and quickly as possible. Despite using a high-quality video projection with a 84deg times 63deg field of view, participants overall performance was rather poor. Moreover, six of the 16 participants exhibited striking qualitative errors, i.e., consistent left-right confusions that have not been observed in comparable real world experiments. Taken together, this study suggests that even an immersive high-quality video projection system is not necessarily sufficient for enabling natural spatial orientation in VR. We propose that a rapid point-to-origin paradigm can be a useful tool for evaluating and improving the effectiveness of VR setups in terms of enabling natural and unencumbered spatial orientation and performance.","publicationTitle":"Virtual Reality Conference, 2007.
