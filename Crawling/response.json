		"abstract": "In this paper a practical case from an Austrian mechanical engineering company is presented. Simulation based manufacturing system improvement is applied to their component manufacturing plant. Based on the high number of items in the real case, a method for reduction of simulation model complexity applying item aggregation is developed in this paper. In the first improvement step, strategic capacity investment decisions are supported with the use of simulation. In the second step, a MRP planning parameter optimization is performed to improve service level and inventory. Additionally, the effect of capacity related decisions concerning setup time reduction and load-dependent outsourcing is evaluated. The results of this simulation study show that service level and inventory can be significantly improved by optimization of planning parameters and reduction of setup times. In addition, the study shows that load-dependent outsourcing is a viable alternative to capacity investment.",

		"title": "Comparing the performance of two different customer order behaviors within the hierarchical production planning",
		"abstract": "A hierarchical production planning structure enables manufacturing systems to handle customer disturbances with different measures on different planning levels. Two different kinds of customer order behavior can be observed and are as well discussed in literature. In the first, being forecast-evolution-behavior, customers provide a forecast quantity for a specific due date for a long horizon in advance and update their forecast quantities periodically. In the second, being customer-required-lead-time-behavior, customers demand stochastic order amounts with a customer-required-lead-time whereby the manufacturing company generates an aggregated forecast, e.g. for product groups. These required lead times are usually shorter than the forecast-evolution-horizon, but order quantities do not further change. For comparing the influence of both order behaviors on a hierarchical production planning system, a simulation study is performed in which logistic performance measures such as service-level, utilization, capacity-, inventory- and tardiness-costs are analyzed with respect to a normalized forecast quality measure.",

		"abstract": "In this paper two different possible machine allocation policies are studied for a production system consisting of MRP and kanban controlled materials. Performance measures are inventory costs, backorder costs and service level. In policy one, the production system is segmented into one segment for MRP planned materials and one for kanban controlled materials. Policy two implements common machine groups for both kinds of materials. A scalable production planning simulation model is applied which is set up by parameterization of the respective database without any model implementation work. For high set-up times and low number of items, we find that whenever utilization of the production system is high, the production system segmentation policy is preferable. However, for medium and low utilization values common machine groups perform best in all scenarios. The scalable simulation model for different kinds of production systems contributes to further research in this field.",

		"abstract": "This paper presents the structure of a flexible discrete event simulation model for analyzing production systems. Based on BOM and routing information a simulation model is generated to analyze a shop floor structure. Different modules are used for generating customer orders and production orders and handling the material flow until the customer is satisfied. The basic idea is that the modules are not connected directly together but the material flow is routed according the information defined in BOM and routing. The model can apply stochastic behavior for processing times, set up times, purchasing lead time, customer required lead time, customer required amount and segmentation from product group to final product. Conwip and MRPII including MPS are implemented as production planning and control methods. The simulation model can be used for analyzing complex production system structures to evaluate the logistical performance.",

The software developed is modular and designed to work in heterogeneous environments. The method is expected to reduce the modeling and maintenance effort considerably when modeling entire factories. The method will result in a holistic and fairly accurate assessment of performance measures for an entire factory.",

In this application, the simulation is used not only as an analysis and evaluation tool, but also as a \"task generator\" for the specification of shop floor control tasks. Using this approach, the effort applied to the development of the simulation is not duplicated in the development of the control system. Instead, the same control logic is used for the control system as was used for the simulation. Additionally, since the simulation implements the control, it provides very high fidelity performance predictions. Implementation experience in two flexible manufacturing laboratories is described. These implementations use a special feature of the Arena/SIMAN simulation language which allows Arena/SIMAN to interact directly with the shop floor control system through an interprocess communication mechanism. This feature is described in detail.",

This rule is easy to implement and has strong intuitive appeal. Given a finite sequence with an arbitrary initial condition, the rule is also optimal, in the sense that it minimizes the width of the marginal confidence interval about the truncated sample mean. We illustrate the performance of the rule by applying it to output generated by multiple runs of four queueing simulations. Models and run conditions provide the test sequences for which truncation is contraindicated, test sequences exhibiting positive and negative initialization bias, and test sequences which are entirely transient. Results demonstrate that the rule is efficient, effective, and consistent with the conflicting objectives of mitigating initialization bias while preserving information.",

Complex routing and control logic is achieved with input and output rules and with actions commands on change of element status. Many interactions are available to help one validate and experiment with the model.
